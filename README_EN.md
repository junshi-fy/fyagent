## A personal control center for the AI era

FyAgent is for people who use AI Agents, AI Workers, and assistants. It brings the choices that shape an AI—where its models come from, which tools it can reach, what skills it has, which instructions it follows, and how it is configured—into one local desktop app.

You do not need to begin with terms such as Provider, MCP, or Prompt. To a person using the product, they are an AI's source of intelligence, its tool connections, and its working instructions. FyAgent makes those choices visible, editable, and easier to carry between tools.

> **Release status:** FyAgent is under active development. Back up important configuration before upgrading, and review the trust information for each release before installing it.

Working data is stored in `~/.fyagent` by default. See the [manual](docs/user-manual/en/README.md) for exact paths, backup instructions, and application-specific limits.

## Interface

The screenshots below use Simplified Chinese. The left navigation opens software configuration, Health, Accounts, Models, Skills, MCP, Prompts, and Memory.

## Quick start

1. Download the package for your system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fy-agent/fyagent/releases/latest).
2. Open **AI software configuration** and scan the device for installed applications.
3. Select an application and open its configuration page. Use the controls available there for models, Skills, MCP, prompts, or authentication.
4. Review the affected settings before saving. After the write, follow the page guidance to inspect the result or test the connection.

See the full [English manual](docs/user-manual/en/README.md), or switch to [简体中文](docs/user-manual/zh/README.md) or [日本語](docs/user-manual/ja/README.md).

## Downloads and release verification

Release files use these names:

- macOS: `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS.dmg`
- Windows: `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-x64-setup.exe`, `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-arm64-setup.exe`

Windows releases use an NSIS setup program; MSI and portable ZIP packages are not part of the current release. macOS builds are signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized.

Before installing, read the release notes and check the published checksums, `signing-status.json`, and build attestation. `NotSigned` describes the signing state; it does not prove that a file is safe. If Windows blocks the installer, see [unblocking instructions](docs/user-manual/en/installation.md#if-windows-blocks-the-installer). See the [installation guide](docs/user-manual/en/installation.md) for platform-specific steps and the [release notes index](docs/release-notes/README.md) for version history.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows blocked the installer or showed 'Windows protected your PC'. What should I do?</strong></summary>

FyAgent Windows installer packages currently do not include an Authenticode signature and are marked as `NotSigned` on the release page. If blocked, follow the "verify first, allow later" principle:
1. Verify the SHA-256 hash in PowerShell using `Get-FileHash` against the release table (if the hash does not match, delete the file and do not run it), optionally also verify the build attestation with `gh attestation verify`.
2. If SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, confirm the application and file name, and click **Run anyway**.
3. If marked from the Internet, open installer **Properties → General** and check **Unblock** if present.
4. For Windows 11 Smart App Control or antivirus false positives, see the [complete unblocking instructions](docs/user-manual/en/installation.md#if-windows-blocks-the-installer).

<summary><strong>Where does FyAgent store its data?</strong></summary>

## Local development

A first checkout requires a global `mise >= 2026.8.6`:

```bash
mise trust
mise run bootstrap
mise run system:check
mise run dev
```

Build for the current system with:

```bash
mise run build
```

Run `mise run check` before submitting a change. The [development guide](docs/fyagent/development/README.md) covers the full toolchain, focused checks, and release requirements.

## Project origin and license

FyAgent began as VibeKey, a concept for a physical keyboard and companion driver. The project later moved to cross-platform desktop software focused on AI application configuration and local data management, and was renamed **FyAgent (For You Agent)**.

The current desktop app evolved from CC Switch and retains upstream copyright and license notices for inherited code. FyAgent-owned components and modifications use the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSES/PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0.txt); commercial use requires separate written authorization. See [LICENSE](LICENSE), [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md), and [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
