# GitHub Release Workflow Contract

## 1. Scope and release authority

This contract owns `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the repository release
helpers under `scripts/release/`, their fixture suites, and the transaction
that may publish a FyAgent GitHub Release. Read it before changing release
events, eligibility, native runners, signer configuration, artifact ownership,
attestation, Release notes, or the final publication request.

Per-asset NSIS mechanics, install-path behavior, Windows signing evidence, and
manual native install/uninstall diagnostics are owned by
[Windows Installer](./windows-installer.md). Frozen Shell-user startup and
single-instance input containment are owned by
[Windows Runtime Security](./windows-runtime-security.md). This workflow owns
their orchestration, frozen inputs, aggregate evidence, and publication gate.

The workflow supports diagnostic preflight plus two equivalent formal entry
events:

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    mode:
      required: true
      type: choice
      options: [preflight, formal]
    source_sha:
      required: false
push:
  tags:
    - "v*.*.*"
```

The YAML tag filter is only routing. The repository-owned eligibility engine
accepts exactly stable `vX.Y.Z` with no prerelease, build metadata, missing
component, or leading zero.

- `workflow_dispatch(mode=preflight)` is an optional three-target diagnostic.
  The workflow itself must be dispatched from the trusted `main` workflow ref,
  while `source_sha` names the immutable candidate commit to build and may
  differ from the workflow/event SHA. Preflight may build/package native
  targets, prove and seal Windows bytes, create workflow artifacts, and attest
  candidate bytes, but it can never create/update a GitHub Release and is not a
  release closure prerequisite. Preflight candidate code receives no Windows
  signing or Apple Developer ID/notarization secrets.
- formal publication may begin either from the normal stable tag `push`, or
  from `workflow_dispatch(mode=formal)` executed **at that existing stable tag
  ref**. Formal dispatch requires `source_sha` to be empty because the selected
  tag is authority. In both formal events the workflow ref, workflow SHA,
  event SHA, checked-out source, canonical Cargo version, Release tag, and live
  remote tag target must collapse to the same release identity. This makes an
  exact tag/SHA retry possible without moving or pushing the tag again.
- The normal web Actions Run workflow branch picker is not formal-release
  authority. An operator retrying formal mode must dispatch the workflow at
  the tag ref (for example with `gh workflow run release.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f
mode=formal` or the equivalent Actions API request); dispatching the current
  branch and merely passing a tag string is forbidden.
- The remote tag may be annotated or lightweight. Formal `sourceSha` is that
  tag's target commit.
  Live `main` HEAD may move during the run. Exact-source push CI is not a
  publication gate; the Release compile is the proof.
- `main` is the trusted workflow branch for preflight and the observed formal
  mainline branch.
  Runtime eligibility does not infer publication from branch protection,
  rulesets, merge settings or a separate provenance workflow. Mainline merge
  protection is independently owned by [Merge Governance](./github-merge-governance.md);
  those controls are not formal tag-release eligibility evidence.
- no branch push, manual signed mode, partial target mode, cross-architecture
  substitute, local publish path, or published update-in-place path exists.

Concurrency is identity-based rather than event-based. Both a tag push and a
formal dispatch for `vX.Y.Z` join `release-formal-vX.Y.Z` with
`cancel-in-progress: false`; preflight uses `release-preflight-<source SHA>`.
This prevents two supported formal entry events from mutating the same Release
transaction concurrently.

Creating/pushing the tag and invoking the remote preflight are parent-task
operations. Local tests and this specification do not authorize either action.

## 2. Frozen release identity

Eligibility is the sole producer of these values:

```text
app_version   = canonical Cargo stable version
release_tag   = "v" + app_version
source_sha    = explicit candidate commit (preflight) | tag target commit (formal)
workflow_sha  = trusted main workflow/event commit (preflight) | source_sha (formal)
release_mode  = preflight | formal
ci_run_id     = null
ci_run_attempt = null
```

Every platform build, metadata writer, signer boundary, asset verifier,
attestation, and publication step consumes these values unchanged. Downstream
jobs must not strip a ref, reread a second version source, or substitute a
different source/workflow SHA.

Preflight binds an explicit candidate SHA while the workflow/event identity is
independently bound to the trusted `main` workflow ref. Formal mode binds the
remote tag's target commit regardless of whether the event is tag `push` or a
manual dispatch at the same tag ref. Preflight is artifact-producing
diagnostic evidence, not formal release authority or a closure gate.

The frozen output has exact keys:

```json
{
  "appVersion": "X.Y.Z",
  "releaseTag": "vX.Y.Z",
  "sourceSha": "<40 lowercase hex>",
  "workflowSha": "<trusted workflow SHA; equals sourceSha only in formal mode>",
  "ciRunId": null,
  "ciRunAttempt": null,
  "mode": "preflight | formal"
}
```

Later remote checks compare every key to this frozen value. A newer tag object
that no longer points at the frozen commit fails the live recheck. A moved
`main` HEAD does not.

## 3. Repository-owned eligibility and remote evidence

`scripts/release/dev-release-eligibility.mjs` is pure logic over normalized
schema `fyagent-dev-release-eligibility-input/v2`. It performs no network or
Git operation. The repository-owned remote collector reads GitHub through the
workflow token, constructs that exact schema, calls the pure evaluator, and
may compare against a previously frozen output.

Eligibility fails closed unless all of these facts agree:

1. repository name/id are `fy-agent/fyagent` / `1313497021`;
2. the workflow is `Release` at `.github/workflows/release.yml`;
3. the canonical version is stable `X.Y.Z` and the tag is exactly `vX.Y.Z`;
4. preflight is `workflow_dispatch(mode=preflight)` from `refs/heads/main`;
   event SHA equals workflow SHA, the explicit `source_sha` input equals the
   frozen candidate source, candidate source may differ from workflow SHA, and
   remote tag evidence is absent;
5. formal event SHA and workflow SHA both equal the frozen source;
6. formal is either a tag `push` or `workflow_dispatch(mode=formal)` with empty
   `source_sha`; event/ref/workflow ref are the same version tag, and the remote ref
   is either a Git `tag` object (annotated: exact name, target type `commit`,
   target SHA equals the frozen commit) or a Git `commit` object (lightweight:
   SHA equals the frozen commit and `tagObject` is null);
7. live `main` HEAD is observed for remote repository evidence but is not
   required to equal either the preflight candidate or a formal frozen source.

Unknown keys, malformed IDs/SHA/statuses, HTTP errors, wrong
repository/workflow/event/ref, a tag whose target is not the frozen commit,
missing tag evidence, or evidence URL drift are failures. A later `main` move
does not invalidate an already frozen preflight workflow SHA. Tokens and API
responses are not written to Release notes or logs. Missing, empty, or failed
exact-source push CI does not fail eligibility.

### Repository owner-transfer boundary

The former-owner repository URL was
`https://github.com/NongHua123/fyagent`. Redirect continuity and historical
source references preserve old run/source evidence only; they are not
eligibility aliases. Current collection and evaluation require the exact
canonical name `fy-agent/fyagent` and numeric repository ID `1313497021`; a
payload, workflow reference, metadata URL, or head-repository name that still
presents the former owner fails closed.

Initial eligibility freezes the decision before any build. Formal publication
re-downloads every private-draft attachment and requires the complete remote
set to match the verified local payload byte-for-byte before publication.
Binary asset reads use an asset-specific request header set with exactly the
`application/octet-stream` media type; they must not inherit the JSON API
`Accept` header, because multiple `Accept` headers can make GitHub return asset
metadata JSON with HTTP 200 instead of the uploaded bytes. Because GitHub
Release asset reads can also be briefly inconsistent immediately after upload,
this re-download proof may retry the complete set a small bounded number of
times with a fixed delay. Every attempt still uses the same exact asset IDs and
the same byte-level verifier; exhaustion is a hard failure and never weakens or
skips the publication gate.

Formal publication then performs two independent live rechecks with the same collector and exact
frozen value:

- once when the publish job begins, before creating a draft;
- once after draft upload/re-download/digest verification and immediately
  before the one final publication PATCH.

A tag replacement away from the frozen commit, identity drift, or API failure
at either formal recheck stops publication. A later `main` commit does not.
Operators may force-update
`vX.Y.Z` when no GitHub Release exists for that tag; the workflow itself never
moves or deletes the tag. An existing published Release for the tag is an
immutable boundary. An existing draft is recoverable only under the ownership
protocol in section 8; source/provenance mismatch fails closed rather than
being overwritten.

The independent [Windows Installer](./windows-installer.md) contract
additionally requires every version component to fit `0..65535` before Tauri
packages an installer. That narrow representation gate does not create a
second application version.

## 4. Job and trust topology

```text
eligibility
  ├─ build-windows (x64, ARM64) ─┐
  └─ build-macos   (universal) ──┴─ pin-release-build-inputs
                                                 ├─ preflight proof ──────┐
                                                 └─ formal transform      │
                                                     └─ fresh formal seal ┤
                                                                          └─ verify-assets
                                                                               └─ attest
                                                                                    └─ publish (formal tag push or tag-ref dispatch)
```

All build jobs receive only frozen values and check out `source_sha`
directly. Before any signer code executes, the secret-free pin job waits for
all native builds, validates the exact directory/file set, records every
file's version/source/size/SHA-256 in `trusted-build-inputs.json`, and uploads
one `trusted-build-inputs` artifact. Its original artifact ID/digest are job
outputs. All trusted consumers download that original ID. Deleting it causes a
failure; uploading a same-name replacement yields another ID and cannot
replace the pinned bytes. Because `download-artifact` extracts a single match
directly into the requested path, the one macOS artifact is downloaded by
exact name into its own explicit `installers-macos-universal` directory.

The preflight and formal Windows paths are mutually exclusive:

- `prove-windows-preflight` contains no provider configuration or secret
  expression. It explicitly requests unsigned mode, proves strict
  `NotSigned`, binds the raw bytes, and uniquely creates the preflight final
  installer and private signing fragment.
- `sign-windows-formal` is the only secret-bearing provider job. It consumes
  pinned raw bytes, validates the mode/configuration matrix, executes the
  provider-neutral transform, and uploads only an explicitly untrusted
  `formal-candidate-*` artifact. It cannot create trusted signing fragments or
  final installer artifacts and never executes the candidate.
- `seal-windows-formal` runs on a fresh matching native runner with no signer
  secret, credential, adapter, dependency install, or candidate build. It
  downloads the original pinned raw input plus the untrusted candidate,
  re-proves raw `NotSigned`, admits only byte-identical unsigned output or an
  Authenticode-only mutation, independently probes the public signature
  policy, and exclusively creates the formal final pair.
- `verify-assets` admits the preflight proof only when both formal jobs were
  skipped, or the formal fresh seal only when the preflight proof was skipped.
  It also requires every native build and the immutable input pin to succeed
  before aggregating the exact installer and evidence sets.
- `sign-updates-formal` runs only after the immutable pin, final macOS build,
  and fresh Windows formal seal succeed. Only its signing step receives Tauri
  private-key values. It signs final EXEs and the complete notarized/stapled
  macOS app archive with the locked CLI; it never signs during `tauri build`.
  The archive and updater additions travel by original immutable artifact IDs.
  Secret-free aggregation rechecks key IDs and Ed25519/BLAKE2b signatures
  against the actual final package bytes before attestation. Preflight requires
  this job to be skipped and retains its original evidence set.
- `attest` declares an explicit non-cancellation status condition so the
  intentionally skipped half of the mutually exclusive Windows topology does
  not trigger GitHub Actions' implicit success-only dependency propagation.
  Its first step then requires both direct needs, `eligibility` and
  `verify-assets`, to report `success`; any other non-cancelled result fails the
  job visibly instead of silently skipping attestation.
- `publish` also declares an explicit non-cancellation status condition and is
  reachable only for formal mode after successful `eligibility` and `attest`
  direct needs. A preflight dispatch still skips publication; a formal dispatch
  at the exact tag ref follows the same formal signing/sealing/publication path
  as a tag push.
  With a configured mirror it additionally requires `sync-update-mirror`
  success; without a mirror that dependency must be skipped. The mirror job
  consumes attested attachments, uploads payloads/signatures before its static
  manifest, and requires public manifest/signature/URL and SHA-256 readback.
  It runs before the GitHub draft transaction and receives no GitHub write
  permissions. S3 credential values exist only in its upload step.

The Release workflow deliberately has no job that launches a Windows setup
executable or performs install -> verify -> uninstall. Successful matching
native build/package jobs are the platform acceptance boundary. The manual
`verify-windows-nsis-lifecycle.ps1` harness may be used for diagnostics, but
the workflow does not invoke it and its result is not a preflight, attestation,
or publication gate.

The formal provider therefore has authority to transform its candidate or
cause a denial of service, but it cannot replace pinned build inputs or create
trusted release evidence. No Release job executes the final setup bytes, and
signer material remains isolated from the fresh sealing boundary.

## 5. Runner, architecture, and toolchain contract

Direct third-party Actions use reviewed full commit SHAs. Required jobs do not
use `*-latest` or execute mise. Node is established after pnpm on native
build jobs. Release does not restore/save shared dependency or build caches:
`setup-node` explicitly uses `package-manager-cache: false` without `cache`,
Rust Action caching stays `cache: false`, uv caching stays disabled, and no
`actions/cache` or Rust cache step is admitted. Dependencies come from locked
upstream downloads. Native CI's separate cache policy does not authorize cache
consumption by Release. Repository Cargo config must not set `RUSTC_WRAPPER`
or sccache.

This removes the Release cache-consumer path but does not redefine preflight
trust: manually selected candidate source still runs under the trusted-main
workflow context described above. A SHA being immutable does not make it
reviewed code. Do not dispatch unreviewed candidates or describe cache removal
as full isolation from default-branch cache-token access/other consumers.
Changing candidate admission or event/ref isolation requires a dedicated
compatibility and privilege review rather than an implicit cache-key change.

Platform-neutral Release control-plane jobs—eligibility, immutable build-input
pinning, exact asset/evidence aggregation, attestation, and publication—run on
the pinned `ubuntu-24.04` hosted runner. They do not compile, execute, sign, or
package a shipped target. Native build, Windows proof/sign/seal, and macOS
Developer ID/notarization jobs remain on matching platform runners.

| Target          | Runner/build environment                | Exact installer output              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Windows x64     | `windows-2025`, native `X64`            | x64 NSIS setup EXE                  |
| Windows ARM64   | `windows-11-vs2026-arm`, native `ARM64` | ARM64 NSIS setup EXE                |
| macOS universal | `macos-15`, both Apple targets          | one UDZO DMG from the universal app |

Each target verifies documented `runner.os`/`runner.arch`, the requested
runner label, source HEAD, and the exact Node, pnpm, and Rust selections from
`.node-version`, `package.json#packageManager`, and `rust-toolchain.toml`. Windows
builders additionally resolve a bounded Visual Studio 2022/2026 installation
through `vswhere`, require the host-architecture VC tools component, load the
matching `VsDevCmd` environment, and record the selected Visual Studio
installation and `VCToolsVersion`. There is
no emulator, architecture impersonation,
opposite-architecture toolchain, or reduced-target fallback. ARM runner
unavailability blocks acceptance.

## 6. Platform build, package, and security gates

### Windows

- application and bundle commands use the formal release manifest and verify
  exact PE architecture, `requireAdministrator`, `uiAccess=false`, and one
  execution-level manifest entry;
- `verify-windows-nsis-contract.mjs` runs before packaging and on the produced
  setup. It binds the reviewed Tauri template, Windows-only NSIS target,
  standard NSIS install-directory handling, independent strict ProgramData
  runtime creation/admission, and bounded uninstall ownership;
- raw setup bytes leave build runners only after strict `NotSigned` proof and
  an empty PE security directory;
- the final x64 and ARM64 bytes must agree on signed/unsigned mode. Complete
  provider configuration requires `Valid`, expected publisher/certificate,
  Code Signing EKU, and timestamp policy. Missing signer mode may produce
  strict unsigned evidence. Partial, empty-active, malformed, failed,
  mismatched, or post-sign-mutated states fail and never downgrade;
- each matching native Windows runner compiles the release application,
  verifies its PE architecture and elevated manifest, and packages exactly one
  NSIS setup executable before proof/signing and fresh sealing;
- before raw upload, and again after preflight/formal sealing, the x64 and
  ARM64 setup PE resources must each contain exactly one canonical FyAgent icon
  group whose referenced frames match `src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` byte-for-byte;
  a configured path without matching final resources is not accepted. Each
  verifier invocation is a mandatory, unmasked command: shell constructs that
  ignore or overwrite its nonzero status are forbidden by workflow mutation
  tests;
- installer execution, registry/shortcut/runtime observation, uninstall, and
  user-data preservation remain available through the manual lifecycle
  diagnostic and are not Release acceptance requirements.

### macOS

- one universal app contains `arm64` and `x86_64`, the frozen version, and
  bundle identifier `com.fyagent.desktop`;
- preflight packages a styled macOS DMG from the candidate universal app
  without injecting Apple Developer ID or notarization secrets. It verifies
  version, bundle identifier, both architectures, DMG layout, and byte
  preservation, but does not claim Developer ID signature or notarization;
- formal-mode Apple Developer ID secrets exist only in the guarded signing /
  notarization steps inside `build-macos`. Before `sign-app`, the job builds
  the Swift privileged helper, embeds it at the frozen LaunchServices and
  Frameworks paths, and runs
  `verify-macos-privileged-helper.sh --structure-only`. `sign-app` then signs
  inside-out: `libFyAgentPrivilegedClient.dylib`, then
  `com.fyagent.desktop.system-commit-helper`, then `FyAgent.app`. Do not use
  `--deep` for nested helper code. Formal signing requires both nested
  binaries; `FYAGENT_ALLOW_APP_ONLY_SIGN=1` is local/diagnostic only. Helper
  identity and the production enablement gate are owned by
  [macOS Privileged System-Commit Helper](./macos-system-commit.md). Those
  steps import a
  temporary keychain, re-seals the complete app with
  `Developer ID Application: William Wang (HY446996QX)` / team `HY446996QX`,
  the hardened runtime, a secure timestamp, and the checked-in entitlements,
  then verifies that identity without requiring a stapler ticket yet. The job
  archives the signed app with `ditto -c -k --keepParent` into a private
  temporary ZIP and submits it to Apple. After acceptance, it staples and
  fully verifies the app before copying it into the styled DMG. It then
  signs and separately notarizes the final DMG. The nested privileged helper
  is included in the app submission, not submitted independently.
  Both notarization operations reuse one submit/poll implementation without `--wait`, then poll
  `notarytool info` until `Accepted` / `Invalid` or a multi-hour budget;
  `notarytool wait --timeout` is not used because it exits 124 with JSON on
  stderr while Apple may still be In Progress. Only an Accepted result permits
  stapling the corresponding artifact. The app submission ZIP is removed
  after acceptance and never becomes a Release asset; teardown also removes
  the private state on failure. The `build-macos` job retains
  `timeout-minutes: 360` as the total job bound, including both submissions.
  Formal packaging allocates `FYAGENT_NOTARY_WAIT_SECONDS=9000` per
  submission so the two waits leave room for building and packaging.
  Strict deep verification must
  report the exact identity, `runtime` flags, a timestamp, and sealed
  resources. The published DMG container must carry a stapled ticket. The
  app inside the final mounted DMG must also pass complete signature and
  stapled-ticket verification. The app is not modified or re-signed after
  its ticket is attached. An ad-hoc
  signature, missing team, missing timestamp, or missing required ticket is
  rejected;
- the DMG source folder contains `FyAgent.app`, a symlink named
  `Applications` whose target is `/Applications`, and
  `.background/background.png` copied from
  `src-tauri/icons/dmg-background.png`. `build-macos` calls
  `scripts/release/create-macos-dmg.sh` as the only styled-DMG entry. That
  script creates a UDRW HFS+ image, attaches it, writes Finder layout with
  `scripts/release/write-dmg-layout.py` (`ds_store` + `mac_alias` via the
  uv group `dmg-layout`), converts to UDZO, and verifies. AppleScript,
  Finder, `osascript`, `dmgbuild` CLI, `appdmg`, and `--skip-jenkins` are
  forbidden. Layout constants: window `660x400` pt, icon size `128` pt,
  `FyAgent.app` at `(180, 188)`, `Applications` at `(480, 188)`, volume
  name `FyAgent`. Alias records must be created against the mounted volume
  file, not the staging directory. After `hdiutil attach` of the final DMG,
  the workflow requires the app, the Applications symlink (`-L` and
  `readlink` equals `/Applications`), `.background/background.png`,
  `.DS_Store`, and the signed app. The volume stays UDZO/read-only; Finder
  drag-install is left-to-right. Layout details are in
  [macOS Styled DMG Layout](./macos-dmg-layout.md). No
  `FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS.zip` is produced;
- DMG `create` and `convert` remove their explicit destination before the
  first attempt and after every failed attempt. They must not delete the
  UDRW convert source. DMG verification preserves the completed input
  across attempts. `create`, `convert`, and `verify` retry the same
  arguments only when the captured diagnostic contains `Resource busy` or
  `Resource temporarily unavailable`, with at most five attempts and `2`,
  `4`, `8`, and `16` second delays. Any other diagnostic, an exhausted
  retry budget, or inability to remove a partial destination returns the
  original `hdiutil` status immediately. The workflow does not pipe
  `hdiutil`, force-detach images, or kill disk-image helpers.
- `build-macos` installs the same pinned `astral-sh/setup-uv` and managed
  Python selected by `.python-version` as CI, then
  `uv sync --locked --group dmg-layout`. Default
  `uv sync --locked` on Linux/Windows must not install that group.

## 7. Assets, metadata, signing disclosure, and attestation

The installer allowlist contains exactly three versioned files:

```text
FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS.dmg
FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-x64-setup.exe
FyAgent-X.Y.Z-Windows-arm64-setup.exe
```

Any Windows format other than the two NSIS setup executables, any macOS
installer format other than the versioned DMG, plus v-prefixed
filenames, unversioned names, architecture aliases, missing files, extras,
directories, symlinks, empty files, or overwrites is forbidden.

`download-manifest.json` schema `fyagent-download-manifest/v3` binds each
installer's exact name, platform, architecture, format, size, SHA-256, URL,
version, tag, source SHA, and publication instant. Its download URL uses the
canonical `https://github.com/fy-agent/fyagent/releases/download/` prefix;
redirecting pre-transfer URLs are not emitted as current metadata.

Three `fyagent-platform-build/v3` records—`macos-universal.json`,
`windows-x64.json`, and `windows-arm64.json`—bind target/runner, common
toolchain, platform-specific native toolchain, repository/workflow/run, source,
and release mode. Windows records contain exact `visualStudio` and `msvc`
versions; the macOS record requires `nativeToolchain: null`. Hosted-image
implementation variables such as `ImageOS` and `ImageVersion` are not accepted
as provenance. `build-metadata.json`
schema `fyagent-build-metadata/v2` reconstructs those records through exact key
allowlists and emits `requiredCi` as null when frozen eligibility has no CI
run.

The two private Windows fragments are normalized into public
`signing-status.json`. Release notes generate their Windows table only from
that verified metadata. Unsigned assets must explicitly say both architectures
are not Authenticode signed and still list SHA-256, source SHA, and
attestation. Signed mode reports the verified public certificate policy; no
credential or adapter secret is included.

Preflight attestation subjects are the three installers plus
`download-manifest.json`, `build-metadata.json`, and `signing-status.json`
(six subjects). Formal adds both EXE `.sig` files,
`FyAgent-X.Y.Z-macOS-universal.app.tar.gz`, its `.sig`, and `latest.json`
(eleven subjects). The Sigstore bundle is copied to
`artifact-attestation.sigstore.json`; it does not attest itself. The exact
Release attachment count is seven for preflight workflow payloads and twelve
for formal. All collectors, verifiers and publication helpers preserve exact
file-set equality, never subset or extension-only admission.

`scripts/release/updater-manifest.mjs` owns the pure Tauri v2 static manifest
contract: exact version/notes/pub_date/platforms, four supported platform keys,
exact `.sig` contents, canonical HTTPS URLs and matching minisign key IDs.
Formal eligibility rejects test key ID `B24D446F5B80F951`, disabled-signing
config drift and missing signing secrets before any native build. Eligibility
receives presence booleans only. `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` remains false.
The signer CLI uses `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`,
mapped from the required repository signing secrets. No private material is
written to disk or uploaded; CLI output is suppressed.
macOS archives contain one top-level `FyAgent.app`; AppleDouble metadata
generation is disabled because the updater uses Rust tar extraction. The
extracted app must retain the exact bytes, valid code signature and stapled
ticket before archive upload. A published same-tag Release is rejected in
eligibility before any mirror side effects.

`vars.FYAGENT_UPDATE_MIRROR_BASE_URL` is validated and frozen in eligibility;
formal native compilation embeds BASE_URL + `/latest.json` only when nonempty.
An empty value skips synchronization and emits an explicit unconfigured-mirror
summary. A nonempty value requires all S3 endpoint/bucket/access credentials;
the prefix alone may be empty. Upload uses hosted-runner AWS CLI with explicit
endpoint, environment credentials and no persisted credentials. Public curl
readback forces HTTPS including redirects, bypasses caches, bounds connection
and transfer time, and retries the full proof at most four times. A stale or
invalid manifest, signature/URL mismatch, corrupt package or sig file fails.

## 8. Permissions and publication transaction

Workflow default permission is `contents: read`.

- remote eligibility/rechecks receive only `contents: read`, `actions: read`,
  and `checks: read`;
- attestation receives `contents: read`, `id-token: write`,
  `attestations: write`, and `artifact-metadata: write`;
- the formal publish job alone receives `contents: write` after every build,
  Windows proof/seal, exact-asset, metadata, and attestation dependency
  succeeds;
- provider secrets exist only in the formal Windows transform job. Apple
  Developer ID secrets exist only in formal-mode `build-macos` steps. Neither
  secret set reaches preflight candidate execution, fresh sealing,
  aggregation, notes, or specs.

The publish job has an explicit formal-mode condition. A stable tag push and a
`workflow_dispatch(mode=formal)` run whose workflow ref is that same tag are
equivalent publication entry events; preflight dispatch evaluates to false.
It performs this transaction:

1. re-evaluate live remote eligibility against the frozen identity;
2. require the exact twelve formal attachments and dynamic English notes file
   `docs/release-notes/${RELEASE_TAG}-en.md`;
3. generate the signing disclosure from verified metadata;
4. list all Releases, including drafts. More than one Release for the tag is a
   failure. A published Release is immutable and fails immediately. A lone
   draft may proceed only through the owned-draft recovery protocol below;
5. after any owned stale draft has been safely recovered, create one fresh
   private draft with a run/attempt/source ownership marker;
6. upload all attachments, list them, re-download by identity, and prove exact
   name, asset ID, non-empty state, and SHA-256 equality;
7. re-read the draft identity/state/marker and re-evaluate live remote
   eligibility against the same frozen output immediately before publication;
8. issue one PATCH to `draft=false`, `prerelease=false`, `make_latest=true`;
9. re-read by Release ID, verify exact published identity/asset IDs, and
   independently confirm it is Latest; then publicly read back
   `releases/latest/download/latest.json`, require this run's frozen version,
   signatures and canonical versioned URLs, and hash all updater packages.
   Failure marks the job failed and reports the published state; it does not
   undo an already public Release.

Mirror-first ordering is required because a successful stale mirror response
does not fall back to GitHub. Mirror failure must block GitHub publication.
If the later GitHub transaction fails, mirror users may already see the new
version; no automatic mirror rollback is allowed. Operational configuration,
first-formal live checks, and the cross-store failure boundary are documented
in `docs/fyagent/app-update-maintenance.md`.

### Owned draft recovery protocol

The marker is intentionally only the first discriminator, not sufficient
proof of ownership:

```text
<!-- fyagent-release-transaction:run=<run>;attempt=<attempt>;source=<sha> -->
```

`scripts/release/verify-release-draft-ownership.mjs` requires that marker to
occur exactly once as the final body suffix and to bind the current frozen
source. The draft itself must also remain private, non-prerelease, named
`FyAgent vX.Y.Z`, have `target_commitish` equal the frozen source SHA, and have
no `published_at` value. The publish job then reads the exact originating
Actions run attempt and its exact attempt job set and fails closed unless all
of these agree:

- repository and head repository are exactly `fy-agent/fyagent` with numeric
  ID `1313497021`;
- the originating workflow is `Release` at `.github/workflows/release.yml`;
- the run/attempt numbers equal the marker and the run `head_sha` equals the
  current frozen source;
- the original run is completed with `failure`, `cancelled`, or `timed_out`;
- the exact attempt contains one `Publish stable GitHub Release` job bound to
  the same run/source/workflow, and its exact transaction step
  `Stage, re-download, and publish one stable Release transaction` ended in a
  recoverable failure/cancellation;
- the draft `created_at` instant falls inside that exact transaction step's
  `started_at`..`completed_at` interval;
- the attempt job response is complete within the bounded one-page set.

Immediately before deletion, the workflow re-reads the draft by Release ID and
re-runs the same ownership/provenance proof. Only then may it issue one DELETE
for that **draft Release ID**. It requires HTTP 204 and then a by-ID GET to
return 404 before creating the replacement draft. Transport ambiguity,
non-204 deletion, a still-resolving ID, source drift, a foreign workflow/run,
successful originating publication work, or any other provenance mismatch
fails closed. It never deletes individual assets to approximate an update and
never deletes or moves the Git tag.

This is deliberately delete-and-recreate rather than asset-by-asset resume:
the next attempt receives one clean transaction and cannot expose a mixture of
old and newly generated assets. Published Releases are never eligible for this
recovery path.

The current-document contract permits versioned notes only for the version in
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, with the exact `en`, `zh`, or `ja` suffixes. Every
present note must be non-empty and linked from `docs/release-notes/README.md`.
This keeps the required English formal-release note reachable on the same
source SHA as the tagged formal build, while rejecting stale or unrelated
version files. After publication, the versioned files may
be removed whole; published history remains in Git history and GitHub
Releases.

`CHANGELOG.md` is a separate release-check gate, not part of `version:set`.
When Cargo `workspace.package.version` is `X.Y.Z`, the first version heading
in `CHANGELOG.md` must match `^## \[X.Y.Z\] - 20\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`. The
text until the next `## [` heading must contain non-empty notes after
stripping HTML comments. Keep a Changelog preamble above that heading is
allowed. `scripts/release/verify-changelog-release.mjs` is invoked by
`mise run release:check`. The write set of `version:set` / `version:bump`
remains `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` plus the two local Cargo.lock package
blocks.

The failure handler for the **current** attempt never deletes its just-created
draft, retries the final PATCH, updates a published Release, or moves/deletes
the tag. Before PATCH, failures leave and report the draft; a later formal run
may recover it only through the protocol above. After PATCH is attempted, one
read-only observation reports draft/published/unknown; an ambiguous outcome is
never called private or successful, and automatic recovery must not proceed
until the Release is again provably an owned private draft.

## 10. Validation and evidence boundary

Local gates cover the pure classifier/eligibility/required evaluators, remote
collector fixtures, version/release metadata, workflow structure, exact asset
sets, signing adapter policy, Windows NSIS contract, task docs, type checking,
formatting, and action-pin audits. Hermetic tests must include wrong repository,
workflow, event, branch, SHA, tag type, version, lightweight and annotated
tags, a moved formal `main` HEAD, a moved preflight branch, HTTP failure,
frozen-output drift, preflight non-publication, formal tag-ref dispatch
publication, formal push/dispatch concurrency identity, both preflight/formal
tail-job truth tables, owned-draft source/marker/run/workflow/job/step proof,
published/foreign draft rejection, bounded deletion confirmation, mutation of
explicit status conditions or direct-need assertions, asset loss/extra, signer
policy, transaction failure, one reusable `notarytool submit` implementation
used for the app archive and final DMG, `notarytool info`
polling, no `xcrun notarytool wait` invocation, `notarytool log` on a denied
submission, `FYAGENT_NOTARY_WAIT_SECONDS`, `build-macos`
`timeout-minutes: 360`, the Applications symlink inside the DMG, `.background/background.png`,
root `.DS_Store`, `create-macos-dmg.sh`, `write-dmg-layout.py`, `dmg-layout`
uv group, changelog heading contract, and the
absence of a macOS ZIP installer.

`tests/releaseWorkflow.test.ts` must keep `build-macos-privileged-helper.sh`,
`embed-macos-privileged-helper.sh`, and
`verify-macos-privileged-helper.sh --structure-only` before `sign-app`.

Local execution cannot establish another platform's PowerShell/NSIS/
Authenticode, native build/package output, macOS bundle, GitHub attestation, or
public Release evidence. The manual Windows install lifecycle is diagnostic
evidence outside this Release closure. Closure requires, in order:

1. a stable `vX.Y.Z` tag, annotated or lightweight, whose target is the
   intended source SHA (Cargo version on that commit equals the tag);
2. one serialized formal build workflow for that tag succeeds—either the
   original tag push or a later formal dispatch at that exact tag ref—including
   matching native compiles, signing/notarization, exact assets, disclosure,
   digests, metadata, and attestation;
3. a public, non-prerelease, Latest Release has those exact artifacts;
4. any later optional bookkeeping push is a new `main` HEAD and must satisfy
   its own CI requirements; it is not part of the release transaction.

If no published GitHub Release exists for `vX.Y.Z`, operators may force-update
the tag and start a new formal run. A draft tied to the old source then fails
closed instead of being silently removed. For the common same-tag/same-SHA
failure, do not move the tag: dispatch `mode=formal` at the existing tag ref;
an owned failed draft for that same source can be recovered automatically.

A successful `mode=preflight` dispatch from the trusted `main` workflow may be
run for any explicitly frozen repository candidate SHA to produce and attest
diagnostic installers, but formal closure neither requires nor infers success
from it.

`windows-11-vs2026-arm` is the explicit GA Visual Studio 2026 image; the
workflow does not use the migrating ARM alias. Native runner
unavailability may still block the run. Unsigned Windows installers may trigger
trust prompts; disclosure, SHA-256, and attestation make
the origin auditable but are not equivalent to Authenticode. The repository's
administrative branch-protection and provenance-workflow settings remain
outside runtime eligibility and are not represented as release guarantees.

## 11. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: freeze live `main` HEAD and a prior exact-source `CI / Required` as
formal identity, refuse lightweight tags, cache `src-tauri/target`, or treat a
`notarytool wait` timeout as Apple rejection. Also wrong: require a tag move to
rerun the same formal tag/SHA, dispatch formal mode from a branch workflow ref,
or treat an arbitrary same-tag draft as workflow-owned.

```text
sourceSha = live main HEAD
require successful push CI on that SHA
reject tag objects that are commits (lightweight)
cache path: src-tauri/target
staple an app before Apple has accepted its submission
package an unstapled app, then staple only the source outside the DMG
xcrun notarytool wait "$id" --timeout 1800
# exit 124 / empty stdout => fail the Release job
bump X.Y.Z after every failed unpublished formal run
force-push the same tag just to rerun the same SHA
workflow_dispatch mode=formal from refs/heads/feature/test
delete any draft merely because tag_name matches
```

Correct: the remote tag's target commit is formal `sourceSha`. Annotated and
lightweight tags are both valid. Missing exact-source push CI is not a gate.
The same tag/SHA can be rerun with `workflow_dispatch(mode=formal)` at the tag
ref without a tag mutation. Operators may force-update `vX.Y.Z` while no
published Release exists, but a stale draft from another source fails closed.
Only a same-source failed draft with independently verified Actions
run/attempt/job provenance can be deleted and recreated. A published Release
is immutable.
Release restores/saves no Actions dependency or compiler cache. Download-only
Cargo caching is a separate CI policy, not a Release exception. Submit the
signed app archive without `--wait`, poll its submission id until Accepted,
then staple and verify the app before packaging. Sign and submit the final
DMG, poll its separate id and staple it only after acceptance. Verify the
mounted app's ticket as well as the DMG's. Do not publish the private ZIP.

## Scenario: App ticket before DMG packaging

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: Apple Developer ID notarization is an infra integration. First
  submissions for this team stayed `In Progress` past 30 and 60 minutes and
  later reached `Accepted`. `notarytool wait --timeout` writes JSON to stderr
  and exits 124, which `set -e` treats as failure even while Apple is still
  processing.
- Owner: `scripts/release/macos-developer-id.sh` plus the `build-macos` job in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

### 2. Signatures

- `macos-developer-id.sh notarize-app <app>` creates a private ZIP and waits
  for acceptance through the shared poller.
- `macos-developer-id.sh staple-app <app>` precedes full app verification and
  DMG creation; the signed app is not re-signed afterward.
- `macos-developer-id.sh notarize-dmg <dmg>` follows final DMG signing.
- `xcrun notarytool submit <archive-or-dmg> --output-format json` (no `--wait`)
- `xcrun notarytool info <submission-id> --output-format json`
- `xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> <log-json>` on `Invalid` / `Rejected`
- `xcrun stapler staple <dmg>` follows that container's acceptance.

### 3. Contracts

- Request: one signed app archive and one final signed UDZO DMG, with a
  separate Apple submission id for each. Never resubmit while polling an id.
- Response status values: `Accepted` (success), `In Progress` / `UNKNOWN`
  (keep polling), `Invalid` / `Rejected` (fail).
- Environment: required `FYAGENT_APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`,
  `FYAGENT_APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `FYAGENT_APPLE_ID`,
  `FYAGENT_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`. Optional
  `FYAGENT_NOTARY_WAIT_SECONDS` (default `18000`),
  `FYAGENT_NOTARY_POLL_SECONDS` (default `20`),
  `FYAGENT_NOTARY_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` (default `120`).
- Job: `build-macos` `timeout-minutes: 360`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing secrets or unsigned/non-regular DMG -> fail before submit.
- Submit JSON without a string `id` -> fail; do not poll.
- `notarytool wait` timeout / exit 124 -> must not be the wait path.
- `Invalid` / `Rejected` -> print `notarytool log`, fail, do not staple.
- Non-terminal after wait budget -> fail with id and last status; do not
  upload a second Apple job.
- App `Accepted` -> staple/verify the app, then create the final DMG.
- DMG `Accepted` -> staple/verify the DMG and verify its mounted app ticket.
- App denial, missing submission id or timeout -> stop before staple/package.
- The private app ZIP is not a published installer.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: the app is accepted and stapled before copying; the final DMG is
  independently accepted/stapled and its app copy retains the app ticket.
- Base: `info` stays `In Progress` for more than 60 minutes, then `Accepted`;
  the same submission id is reused.
- Bad: stapling before acceptance; packaging before app staple;
  `wait --timeout 1800` twice; treating 124 as
  rejection; bumping the Cargo version solely because an unpublished tag's
  formal run timed out.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/releaseWorkflow.test.ts` asserts one shared `notarytool submit` implementation,
  presence of `notarytool info` and `notarytool log`, no `xcrun notarytool wait`
  invocation, `FYAGENT_NOTARY_WAIT_SECONDS`,
  `scripts/release/macos-developer-id.sh` subcommands `notarize-app`, `notarize-dmg`,
  `staple-app`, `timeout-minutes: 360` on `build-macos`, the DMG Applications
  symlink, styled layout scripts, and the absence of a public `macOS.zip`.
- Fake-tool execution proves In Progress→Accepted before app staple/package,
  final-DMG submission, and stopping on denial, missing id or timeout.
- Local tests do not call Apple; a successful unit run is not notarization
  evidence.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```bash
xcrun notarytool wait "$id" --timeout 1800 --output-format json >"$out"
# timeout JSON on stderr, empty $out, exit 124, set -e kills the job
```

#### Correct

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit "$dmg" --output-format json   # capture id
xcrun notarytool info "$id" --output-format json      # poll until Accepted
```

## Scenario: Formal tag-target identity

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: Formal publication identity is an infra contract. Historical
  squash-merged commits already present on `main` and unpublished notarization
  timeouts must not require a Cargo bump. Current mainline merge policy is
  owned by [GitHub Merge Governance](./github-merge-governance.md). The workflow
  must not freeze live `main` HEAD or a prior `CI / Required` run as
  `sourceSha`.
- Owner: `scripts/release/dev-release-eligibility.mjs` plus the `eligibility`
  job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

### 2. Signatures

- `workflow_dispatch.inputs.mode = preflight | formal`
- `workflow_dispatch.inputs.source_sha = <sha> | ""`
- `evaluateDevReleaseEligibility({ event.dispatchMode, remoteTag, ... })`
- `verifyRecoverableReleaseDraft(release, runAttempt, jobs, tag, sourceSha)`
- Frozen output keys: `appVersion`, `releaseTag`, `sourceSha`, `workflowSha`,
  `mode`, `ciRunId`, `ciRunAttempt`

### 3. Contracts

- Request: stable `vX.Y.Z` tag whose target commit is the intended source.
  Annotated and lightweight tags are both valid.
- Normal formal entry is a tag push. Manual formal retry is
  `workflow_dispatch(mode=formal)` at the **same tag ref** with empty
  `source_sha`; this is not a branch dispatch carrying an arbitrary tag input.
- Response: `sourceSha = tag target commit`, `workflowSha = sourceSha`,
  `ciRunId = null`, `ciRunAttempt = null`.
- Push and formal dispatch for the same tag share one
  `release-formal-vX.Y.Z` concurrency group with cancellation disabled.
- Operators may force-update unpublished `vX.Y.Z` onto a later SHA. The
  workflow never moves or deletes the tag. Published Releases are immutable.
- An exact-source draft may be deleted/recreated only after marker + exact
  originating Actions run attempt + publish job/transaction-step provenance
  all prove it is residue from a failed FyAgent Release transaction.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Tag target != frozen `sourceSha` during the run -> fail; do not retarget.
- Lightweight tag pointing at another commit -> fail.
- Formal dispatch from a branch ref, with non-empty `source_sha`, or whose
  workflow SHA differs from the tag source -> fail before native builds.
- Missing exact-source push CI -> continue; Release compile is the proof.
- Published GitHub Release already exists for the tag -> fail immutable.
- Same-source owned failed draft -> re-prove immediately before deleting that
  draft ID, require DELETE 204 and GET-by-ID 404, then start a fresh draft.
- Foreign/source-mismatched/success-origin/ambiguous draft -> fail closed.
- Failed unpublished formal run -> operators may force-update the same tag;
  do not bump `X.Y.Z` solely for that timeout. For the same SHA, prefer manual
  formal retry without moving the tag.

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: annotated `v0.4.3` at the intended SHA; its tag-push formal build
  fails before publication; `gh workflow run release.yml --ref v0.4.3 -f
mode=formal` reruns the exact same tag/source without any tag mutation.
- Base: the previous same-source formal transaction left an owned draft; the
  retry proves its exact failed Actions origin, deletes only that draft,
  confirms the ID is gone, and creates a fresh transaction.
- Base: unpublished `v0.4.2` is force-updated onto a later SHA after a
  notarization timeout and no published Release exists; one new formal run
  starts. A draft bound to the old SHA is not auto-deleted.
- Bad: require live `main` HEAD + successful `CI / Required`; refuse
  lightweight tags; force-move a tag just to retry the same SHA; dispatch from
  a branch ref; delete a same-tag draft without provenance; overwrite a
  published release; bump solely because Apple stayed In Progress.

### 6. Tests Required

- `tests/devReleaseEligibility.test.ts` accepts a lightweight formal tag whose
  commit SHA is the frozen source, accepts formal dispatch at that tag, and
  rejects a tag/source/mode mismatch.
- `tests/releaseWorkflow.test.ts` and `tests/devReleaseRemote.test.ts` assert
  frozen `ciRunId` / `ciRunAttempt` are null in formal mode, formal
  push/dispatch share the formal path, preflight cannot publish, and
  concurrency keys by release tag rather than event source.
- `tests/releaseDraftOwnership.test.ts` rejects published, wrong-source,
  wrong-target/time-window, malformed-marker, wrong-repository/workflow/run, successful-origin,
  missing-publish-job, successful-transaction-step, and incomplete-job-set
  evidence; it accepts only a matching failed push/formal-dispatch origin.
- Local tests do not create tags or GitHub Releases.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
sourceSha = live main HEAD
require successful push CI on that SHA
reject lightweight tags
bump X.Y.Z after every failed unpublished formal run
move the same tag to retrigger the same SHA
recover draft based only on tag_name / HTML marker
```

#### Correct

```text
sourceSha = remote tag target commit
ciRunId = null
formal retry = workflow_dispatch at refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
same tag + same SHA => no tag mutation
owned same-source failed draft => prove Actions run/attempt/job, delete draft ID, confirm 404, recreate
published vX.Y.Z => immutable failure
operators may force-update unpublished vX.Y.Z
the workflow never moves the tag
```
