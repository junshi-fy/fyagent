# Backend Development Guidelines

This directory contains the current Rust host, persistence, native-platform,
delivery, and repository-governance contracts. This index is a discovery
surface, not a second source of behavior. Exact signatures, state machines,
error matrices, tests, paths, and security rules belong in the linked owner.

## Reading order

1. Start with [Rust Host Modular Boundaries](./modular-boundaries.md) and
   [Backend Reuse](./reuse.md).
2. Read [Development Environment](./development-environment.md),
   [Repository Task Runner](./task-runner-contract.md), and
   [Database Persistence](./database-persistence.md) when changing shared
   runtime or repository infrastructure.
3. Read the focused feature contract that owns the data, filesystem, process,
   network, secret, or IPC behavior being changed. Managed Auth is split into
   [core/vault/migration](./managed-auth.md),
   [provider login sessions](./managed-auth-login.md),
   [consumer projection](./managed-auth-consumers.md), and
   [managed account proxy binding](./managed-account-proxy.md); cite only the
   owner of the behavior being changed.
4. For platform or delivery work, also read the matching Windows/macOS and
   CI/release governance contracts.

## Core architecture and repository infrastructure

Security-alert triage and independent scan evidence are owned by
[Security Review](./security-review.md), including dependency reachability,
secret handling, native source checks, and residual-risk reporting.

## Product, configuration, and runtime security

[Provider Credential Persistence](./provider-credentials.md) owns production Codex
SecretRef saves, migration, native consumers and secret-free Provider exports.

[Portable Configuration Pack](./config-pack.md) owns selected connection export,
strict import previews, credentialless draft transactions and native file pickers.

[Device-local First-use Guide](./first-use-guide.md) owns new-install eligibility,
settings persistence, narrow commands and protection against stale settings saves.

[Agent Health Observation](./health.md) owns the on-demand local status
snapshot and its read-only installation/configuration/auth/proxy evidence.

[Reversible User Configuration](./reversible-user-config.md) owns the default
backup/atomic-write/undo mechanism, closed recovery commands and disclosure
metadata. Read it before any user-file write; domain-specific locks and native
path protections remain with the focused contracts below.

[Claude Code CLI](./claude-code-cli.md) owns the CLI-only distribution contract
and reuse of Grok's npm mirrors and ordinary-user execution boundary.

## Compatibility entry points

- [External Agent P0](./external-agent-p0.md) routes archived broad Agent,
  Skill, and MCP references to focused owners.
- [External Agent Configuration](./external-agent-configuration.md) routes
  archived combined Qoder/TRAE/OpenCode configuration references.

New task context must cite the smallest focused contract above.

## Maintenance rules

- Keep stable current contracts here. Put investigation logs, migration dates,
  run IDs, reviewed commit hashes, and one-time evidence in Trellis tasks,
  provenance ledgers, CHANGELOG, or Git history.
- Do not copy tool versions from repository authority files into generic specs.
  Contracts may require equality with those sources without duplicating them.
- When two specs touch one operation, name one semantic owner and make the
  other describe only its boundary or orchestration role.
- High-risk native/security/release contracts may remain long when splitting
  would hide fail-closed ordering, rollback, or evidence requirements.

## Quality Check

Use every affected contract's **Tests Required** section. The standard local
implementation gate is `mise run check`; focused backend work may start with
`mise run check:backend`, while docs/task/version/release contract changes use
`mise run check:contracts`. Before archiving an active Trellis task, run the
matching prearchive gate with its exact `--exclude-active-task` path. Portable
checks never replace native runtime, installer, signing, notarization, or
publication evidence required by the owning contract.

Native tests that set or depend on process-wide fixture homes such as
`FYAGENT_TEST_HOME` must use the existing `#[serial_test::serial]` lock and an
RAII guard that restores the previous environment value. A separate temporary
config directory is insufficient when preview/apply also observes a preserved
file through the home resolver. Keep the production revision/target guard and
test assertions intact; do not mask fixture races with retries or weakened
admission. Test-local readers that use only explicit paths need no extra lock.
