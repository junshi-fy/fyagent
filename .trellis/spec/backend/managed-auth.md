# Managed Auth Core, SecretRef Vault, and Legacy Migration Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Read this contract before changing Managed Auth account/credential metadata,
OS-native secret bundles, legacy JSON migration, refresh ownership, account
default/removal semantics, Proxy token resolution, or the core Tauri façade in
`commands/managed_auth.rs`.

Primary owners:

- `src-tauri/src/services/managed_auth/`
- `src-tauri/src/database/dao/managed_auth.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/managed_auth.rs`

Related owners:

- [SecretRef Native Backend](./secretref-backend.md) owns the OS vault leaf.
- [Database Persistence](./database-persistence.md) owns schema/migration
  mechanics and the test-only legacy cloud skip/preserve sets.
- [Managed Accounts](../frontend/managed-auth.md) owns renderer Ports.
- [External Agent Auth](./external-agent-auth.md) remains the Agent-owned
  Claude/desktop handoff façade; it must not grow a second OAuth store.
- [Managed Auth Login](./managed-auth-login.md) owns backend login sessions,
  OpenAI browser/Device Code, xAI Device Code, cancellation and reopen.
- [Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md) owns Codex/Grok/OpenCode
  connection observation, native projection gates, readback and restart state.
- [Managed Account Proxy](./managed-account-proxy.md) owns explicit OpenAI/xAI
  binding to local Agent Providers and the `fyagent_proxy` route projection.

This is the first production consumer of `services::secret`. Do not introduce a
second keyring, a plaintext JSON token authority, or a `shared` refresh owner.

## 2. Signatures

Composition root (`lib.rs` setup):

```text
SecretService::new(NativeSecretBackend::new())
ManagedAuthService::new(db, secrets, config_dir)
ManagedAuthService::startup()
app.manage(ManagedAuthState(Arc<NativeManagedAuthService>))
```

Startup failure is fail-closed overview (`secret_unavailable` /
`migration_blocked`). It must not crash the app and must not fall back to a
file or environment secret store.

Core renderer-facing commands:

```text
managed_auth_get_overview() -> ManagedAuthOverview
managed_auth_set_default_account({ accountId, expectedRevision })
  -> ManagedAuthMutationResult
managed_auth_preview_account_removal({ accountId, expectedRevision })
  -> ManagedAuthAccountRemovalPreview
managed_auth_remove_account({ previewId, accountId, expectedRevision })
  -> ManagedAuthMutationResult
```

Login-session command signatures are owned by
[Managed Auth Login](./managed-auth-login.md). Connection-action signatures are
owned by [Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md). This contract
owns their shared opaque IDs, credential metadata and mutation readback shape,
not their provider/consumer protocol details.

Leftover `commands/auth.rs` (not a second owner):

```text
auth_list_accounts / auth_get_status
  -> read-only; vault after that source is sealed, else JSON
auth_start_login / auth_poll_for_account / auth_remove_account /
auth_set_default_account / auth_logout / auth_cancel_login
  -> always `legacy_auth_mutation_disabled`
```

Leftover `commands/copilot.rs` (not a second login owner):

```text
copilot_start_device_flow / copilot_poll_for_auth /
copilot_poll_for_account / copilot_remove_account /
copilot_set_default_account / copilot_logout
  -> always `legacy_auth_mutation_disabled`
copilot_get_token*
  -> always `copilot_token_not_exposed`
copilot_list_accounts / copilot_get_auth_status /
copilot_is_authenticated / copilot_get_models* / copilot_get_usage*
  -> leftover read-only quota/model compatibility
```

`operationId` on mutation results is a canonical UUID v4 string (hyphenated).
Account IDs are `ma1:` + 32 lowercase hex. Credential IDs are `mcred1:` + 32
lowercase hex. Connection IDs are `mc1:` + 32 lowercase hex. Revisions are
`mr1:` + 64 lowercase hex.

SQLite metadata tables (schema v21):

```text
managed_auth_identities
managed_auth_credentials     // opaque secret_ref + secret_version only
managed_auth_defaults
managed_auth_connections
managed_auth_migrations
```

`refresh_owner` CHECK is `fyagent | codex_native | grok_native | opencode |
unavailable`. There is no `shared` value.

Secret bundle (`ManagedOAuthSecretBundleV1`) is one versioned OS-vault payload
per Credential Session:

```text
schemaVersion, credentialId, provider, generation,
accessToken?, refreshToken?, idToken?, tokenType?,
grantedScopes, issuedAt?, expiresAt?
```

At least one of access/refresh/id is required. Encoded UTF-8 JSON must fit
`MAX_SECRET_BYTES` (2560), the Windows generic-credential blob cap. Tokens
are never truncated and never spilled to a second file. When the encoded
bundle would exceed 2560, omit `idToken` first, then `accessToken` if a
`refreshToken` remains. Identity stays in SQLite metadata; a missing access
token is re-minted from refresh. Fail closed if the remaining fields still
exceed 2560 or contain NUL.

Proxy resolution:

```text
ManagedAuthService::resolve_access_material(provider, legacy_account_id?)
  -> AccessMaterial { access_token (zeroizing), routing_subject? }
```

OpenAI/xAI migrated sessions use `purpose=proxy_upstream`. Copilot uses
`purpose=copilot`. All three use `refresh_owner=fyagent`. The resolver never
returns a refresh token or SecretRef.

## 3. Contracts

### Proxy account boundary

- This core exposes exact-account credential admission and access-material
  resolution only. Provider identity, target activation/draft behavior, model
  suggestions and overview route projection are owned by
  [Managed Account Proxy](./managed-account-proxy.md).
- A proxy consumer must present the public account identity and resolve a
  `Ready` `proxy_upstream` / `fyagent_proxy` credential owned by FyAgent. Native
  consumer lineages are not interchangeable, and a missing vault credential
  never falls back to a default or plaintext legacy account.
- No binding owner may receive a refresh token or SecretRef. The only exported
  request-time material is the zeroizing access token and optional routing
  subject described below.

### Proxy access-material refresh

- `resolve_access_material` returns only a zeroizing access token, optional
  routing subject and private admitted credential lineage. The internal
  `refresh_rejected_access(&AccessMaterial)` uses that same lineage and rejected
  token; it never rereads a default account to recover an in-flight request.
- A credential lock coalesces expiry refresh and simultaneous 401 refreshes.
  Reuse an already-refreshed token only within the same credential, identity,
  provider, purpose, consumer, SecretRef and authentication epoch, still owned
  by FyAgent and Ready. Verify bundle identity and generation before use.
- Refresh HTTP is bounded to 30 seconds. Recheck the exact generation and
  lineage after HTTP, on both success and failure, before CAS or status writes.
  Logout, relogin, deletion or native ownership transfer makes late work stale;
  do not return an unrelated newer session as fallback. Verify committed vault
  readback after CAS; a failed CAS is not success.
- HTTP 400 with an exact `invalid_grant` (or xAI `invalid_token`) code, or a
  definitive refresh 401/403, requires reauthentication. Network failure,
  timeout, throttling, server failure and
  malformed responses preserve the credential for an explicit retry. Missing
  refresh material when renewal is needed requires reauthentication. The
  legacy xAI refresh policy and native consumer owners are not rewritten.

### Identity versus credential session

- `ManagedIdentity` is keyed by `(provider, provider_subject, provider_tenant)`,
  not by email.
- `CredentialSession` is one OAuth/API grant and one rotating refresh-token
  lineage. UI may aggregate sessions onto one account card; backend must not
  merge refresh tokens across consumers.
- Default refresh owner for migrated Proxy-purpose sessions is `fyagent`.

### Secret write admission

Create/migrate a session in this order:

```text
reserve SecretHandle
INSERT credentials status=provisioning with that handle
create_reserved on the OS backend
typed decode readback of ManagedOAuthSecretBundleV1
optional set_default
mark_ready (Ready or RequiresReauth only after readback)
```

Production code must not call `SecretService::create()` for Managed Auth: that
API generates a SecretRef that is not yet durable in SQLite. A native create
that succeeds without authoritative readback keeps the DB SecretRef
(`provisioning` / `secret_missing`) and does not blindly delete the native
item.

Refresh:

```text
per-credential lock
read metadata + bundle + generation + owner
reject unless refresh_owner=fyagent
HTTP refresh through the existing Codex/xAI/Copilot protocol helpers
re-check generation
replace_reserved + update_secret_cas
CAS false => discard the network result; do not overwrite
```

Delete order: clear connections → delete SecretRef → delete credential /
identity metadata. SQLite `ON DELETE CASCADE` is not a license to skip the
native delete.

### Default and account removal

- Default selection accepts only a `Ready` credential under the account's
  exact current revision. A stale revision, missing account, or account without
  a ready credential fails before updating `managed_auth_defaults`.
- Removal is two-step. `preview_account_removal` rereads the account revision
  and lists every connection whose credential belongs to the account.
  `remove_account` recomputes that preview and accepts only the matching
  `previewId + accountId + expectedRevision`; it never trusts a renderer-owned
  impact list.
- Successful removal clears connection references, deletes each native
  SecretRef, then removes credential/orphan identity metadata. Any incomplete
  delete remains an error/recovery state; the overview must not hide a still
  authoritative credential.
- `Ready` credentials that fail native delete stay fail-closed. Credentials
  whose status is already `secret_missing`, `provisioning`, `revoked`, or
  `migration_blocked` (a leftover admission that never stored a vault item)
  still expose `remove` and may finish SQLite cleanup when native delete is
  denied. Do not rewrite status on that path: a revision bump poisons the
  preview.
- A login vault write that fails before `SecItemAdd` succeeds is
  `secret_missing` plus `secret_unavailable`, not `migration_blocked`.
- Mutation success returns a newly generated operation UUID and a freshly
  computed overview. The renderer must not infer success from the command
  returning without an error.

### Legacy JSON migration

Sources, one journal row each:

```text
legacy-codex-oauth-v2   <- codex_oauth_auth.json
legacy-xai-oauth-v1     <- xai_oauth_auth.json
legacy-copilot-auth-v3  <- copilot_auth.json
```

- Parse is strict and bounded. Copilot v1 (token without stable identity)
  stays `blocked`; the source file is left in place.
- Parser output is never `Ready`. Ready happens only after vault readback.
- Sources are isolated: one blocked source must not prevent another source
  from preparing/finalizing.
- Empty JSON stores do not create a journal row and do not seal future writes.
- Finalize: recover + typed readback of every credential for that source →
  persist `completed` + `backup_name` → rename to
  `{filename}.managed-auth-v1.bak`. If the live file is already gone and the
  backup hash matches, treat as completed. Never delete the backup in this
  slice.
- `legacy_store_sealed(id)` is true only for that source's
  `prepared|completed` journal. Vault unavailable or a foreign source failure
  must not seal remaining JSON stores.
- After a source is sealed, startup must call the matching manager's
  `seal_json_store()` and that manager must not write new tokens to plaintext
  JSON. Unsealed sources remain readable until they migrate.

### Proxy and compatibility commands

- `proxy/forwarder.rs` prefers `resolve_access_material` when a fyagent-owned
  vault session exists. Unmigrated / blocked sources may still use the old
  manager path.
- Any credential whose purpose is not `proxy_upstream`, or whose refresh owner
  is not `fyagent`, is rejected by Proxy. Consumer-specific purpose changes,
  native projection and ownership transfer are governed by
  [Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md).
- V1 `commands/auth.rs` may list vault accounts only after that provider's
  JSON store is sealed. Otherwise JSON remains the live **read-only**
  compatibility path for `auth_list_accounts` / `auth_get_status`.
- Leftover mutations stay registered for old clients but always return
  `legacy_auth_mutation_disabled` and must not start Device Code, poll,
  delete accounts, write a second JSON default, logout-all, or cancel a
  leftover login:

```text
auth_start_login
auth_poll_for_account
auth_remove_account
auth_set_default_account
auth_logout
auth_cancel_login
```

Login, reauth, default-account, and removal belong on `managed_auth_*`
with impact preview. Retained Provider metadata may bind an opaque
`authBinding.accountId`; the retired Provider forms and Settings auth tab are
not current renderer entrypoints. Compatibility clients must not call legacy
mutation IPC or create another account authority.

- Renderer DTOs, logs, and overview JSON must not contain tokens, SecretRef,
  `device_code`, verifier, or authorization codes.
- `copilot_get_token*` remains registered for leftover clients but always
  returns `copilot_token_not_exposed`. Leftover `copilot_start_device_flow`,
  `copilot_poll_for_auth`, `copilot_poll_for_account`, `copilot_remove_account`,
  `copilot_set_default_account`, and `copilot_logout` return
  `legacy_auth_mutation_disabled`. Do not add new token-returning commands.
  Proxy must resolve Copilot material natively, never through renderer IPC.
  Leftover Copilot list/status/models/usage may remain read-only.

### Login and consumer boundary

- Provider authorization, process-private session state, callback/device
  polling, cancellation generation and provider-origin validation are owned by
  [Managed Auth Login](./managed-auth-login.md).
- Codex/Grok/OpenCode connection compatibility, auth-file projection,
  consumer-specific purpose, native refresh-owner transfer and
  `pending_restart` evidence are owned by
  [Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md).
- Both layers must enter this core through typed credential admission and
  closed mutation APIs. Account/default/removal revision enforcement stays in
  this core; consumer-specific revision coverage and its residuals stay in
  [Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md). Neither layer may
  write an alternate token store, bypass SecretRef readback, or return secret
  material through IPC.

### Sync and export

Cloud sync is retired. Test-only legacy skip/preserve sets retain coverage
for all `managed_auth_*` tables.
Opaque SecretRef values are device-bound; syncing them to another machine
must not be treated as a portable login. Full SQL export may include
metadata and must never include token columns.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** Codex JSON migrates to SecretRef, overview shows the account
  without tokens, Proxy resolves access through the vault, and the JSON file
  is renamed to a bounded `.bak`.
- **Good:** Copilot v1 is blocked while a valid Codex store still finalizes.
- **Base:** keychain/Credential Manager unavailable. Overview reports
  `secret_unavailable`; an unsealed legacy JSON manager may remain a read-only
  compatibility/resolver source but never becomes a new writable authority.
- **Good:** account removal preview names the current dependent connections;
  apply recomputes the same revision/preview before deleting native secrets and
  metadata.
- **Base:** a stale default/removal request preserves the current overview and
  asks the caller to reread rather than choosing another credential.
- **Bad:** write refresh tokens back to JSON after that source is sealed.
- **Bad:** seal every JSON store because one source failed.
- **Bad:** pre-mark credentials `Ready` in the parser before vault readback.

## 6. Tests Required

```bash
mise run rust:fmt:check
mise run rust:check
mise run rust:clippy
mise run rust:test -- managed_auth
mise run rust:test -- leftover_legacy_auth
mise run rust:test -- leftover_copilot_login
mise run rust:test -- --test secret_service_contract
mise run typecheck
```

Required assertions:

- schema v20→v21 creates the five tables; future `SCHEMA_VERSION+1` fails
  closed; CHECK excludes `shared`; no token columns;
- test-only legacy skip/preserve sets include all `managed_auth_*` tables together;
- bundle 7.2 round-trip, wrong schema rejected, oversized fail-closed,
  OpenAI-sized grants omit `idToken` to fit 2560;
  Debug redaction;
- admission: SecretRef row exists before native create; recover after
  create-without-mark_ready;
- migration idempotent prepare/finalize; failure leaves the source file;
  Copilot v1 does not block Codex finalize;
- vault unavailable does not seal JSON;
- stale generation cannot overwrite; resolver rejects native refresh owners;
  concurrent expiry/401 callers share one same-lineage refresh; deletion,
  relogin and ownership changes reject both late success and terminal failure;
  terminal errors require reauth while transient errors retain Ready;
- exact proxy-account lookup rejects defaults, missing vault sessions,
  non-proxy purposes and native refresh owners. Provider binding, route
  observation and transport replay assertions are owned by
  [Managed Account Proxy](./managed-account-proxy.md),
  [Proxy Runtime](./proxy-runtime.md) and
  [Local Proxy Pipeline](./local-proxy-pipeline.md);
- set-default accepts only a ready credential under exact revision;
  removal preview/apply recomputes impact and rejects stale preview IDs;
  native secrets are deleted before credential/identity metadata;
  non-ready accounts still advertise `remove`; vault delete denial on those
  statuses still completes SQLite cleanup; Ready delete failure stays
  fail-closed;
  login vault create denial before an item exists is `secret_missing` /
  `secret_unavailable`, never `migration_blocked`;
- overview/DTO leak scan includes `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`,

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```text
SecretService::create(material)
  -> native item exists
  -> Err(readback) drops the SecretRef
  -> unreachable keychain item
```

Correct:

```text
handle = reserve()
INSERT provisioning(handle)
create_reserved(handle, material)
typed decode readback
mark_ready
```

Wrong:

```text
any migration error -> seal_json_store() on Codex, xAI, and Copilot
parser status = Ready
rename JSON then write DB completed
```

Correct:

```text
per-source journal
Ready only after typed readback
DB completed + backup_name, then rename
seal only that source
```

Wrong:

```text
auth_start_login -> start JSON Device Code
auth_set_default_account -> write a second JSON default
```

Correct:

```text
leftover auth_start_login / poll / remove / set_default / logout / cancel
  -> legacy_auth_mutation_disabled
leftover copilot_start_device_flow / poll / remove / set_default / logout
  -> legacy_auth_mutation_disabled
managed_auth_* owns login, default, and removal with preview
auth_list_accounts / auth_get_status remain read-only
```
