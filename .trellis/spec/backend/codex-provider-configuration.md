# Codex Provider Configuration Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Read this contract before changing Codex Provider TOML analysis or mutation,
native capability controls, vendor-specific model projection, session-resume
command construction, provider warnings, the `liveConfigChanged` result, or
the Codex Provider Change Plan ledger/readback path.
It owns the Codex provider configuration domain only. Trusted Codex Desktop
discovery, installation, process restart, and launch are owned by
[Codex Desktop Installer](./codex-desktop-installer.md); application version and
release metadata are owned by their dedicated contracts. Managed ChatGPT OAuth
account identity, refresh ownership and JSON-to-vault migration are owned by
[Managed Auth Core](./managed-auth.md). Managed Codex projection admission,
account delta, and connection outcome are owned by
[Managed Auth Consumers](./managed-auth-consumers.md). This contract owns only
the Codex Provider binding boundary plus the existing Codex config/auth writer
semantics; Agent install/launch remains in the focused lifecycle contracts.
The unsealed Codex JSON manager remains a compatibility store until
migration seals that source. Provider rows store
`ProviderMeta.authBinding.accountId` as an opaque account/credential id only.
Legacy binding remap runs only after `CodexOAuthManager` reports a successful
store load. A parse or I/O failure is not an empty account set and must leave
every existing Provider binding unchanged.
The configuration layer reports the effective credential-store fact consumed
by Managed Auth: explicit `file` and unset (the upstream default) are
file-capable; `keyring`, `auto`, `ephemeral`, invalid, and unknown values are
not. This layer never rewrites the key to manufacture capability, and it does
not decide whether a particular account has complete, identity-matched
material. Workspace/account IDs are never HashMap keys.

     }
```

Feature commands reject every `app` other than Codex. No provider command may
accept a renderer-controlled filesystem path. Generic mutation results never
return a filesystem path, process identifier, launch command,
credential-bearing diagnostic, or generic application-version field. The renderer
sanitized summary is the narrow exception: it may return user-visible
`writeTargets` path/backup metadata owned by native path resolution. Paths under
the frozen user home use `~`; the DTO contains no file bytes, digest, Provider
settings, credentials, or arbitrary renderer-supplied path.

Successful Codex add/update mutations may return these stable warning codes:

CODEX_WEBSOCKET_NON_GPT_MODEL
CODEX_WEBSOCKET_PROXY_MAY_BE_UNSUPPORTED
```

## 3. Contracts

### Lossless TOML and native capabilities

- The native analysis/patch capability applies to every valid Codex Provider,
  not only the current Quick Setup form's initially collapsed controls. The
  retired general Provider editor is not a second current renderer. Provider ID, `base_url`,
  credentials, official/managed classification, OAuth type, proxy takeover,
  `wire_api`, and `meta.apiFormat` do not make a valid TOML draft ineligible.
- A fixed official Provider is identified only by `category == "official"` or
  ID `codex-official`. Names, URLs, and `requires_openai_auth` are not
  classifiers.
- Analysis and patching use `toml_edit` and preserve comments, blank lines,
  table and field order, unrelated fields, and unrelated headers. An invalid
  complete TOML document keeps both controls visible but disabled and blocks
  capability writes; it is never reconstructed from parsed form state.
- An invalid `http_headers` or `supports_websockets` field is a non-blocking,
  non-sensitive diagnostic. Ordinary saves preserve the invalid field. Only an
  explicit operation on the corresponding control may repair it.
- The image capability owns only the case-insensitive
  `x-openai-actor-authorization` header whose value is exactly
  `local-image-extension`. Enabling removes every case variant and writes one
  canonical key. Disabling removes every variant and then removes an empty
  header table. Other valid header entries survive.
- If `http_headers` is not a string map, explicit image enable replaces that
  field with the managed map and explicit disable deletes it. No unrelated save
  performs this repair.
- WebSocket configuration is format-agnostic. Enabling always writes boolean
  `supports_websockets = true`; disabling removes the field rather than writing
  `false`. Responses, Chat, Anthropic, managed OAuth, official, and proxy
  Providers remain saveable with the field present.
- Codex image-extension mode on a third-party Provider writes
  `requires_openai_auth = false` in the stored TOML and sets
  `experimental_bearer_token` on the active `[model_providers.<id>]` table.
  Disabling image-extension restores stored `requires_openai_auth = true` and
  omits the stored bearer field. Form/native drafts carry `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`;
  [Provider Credential Persistence](./provider-credentials.md) converts successful
  saves to `credentialRef` and strips both plaintext representations. Native
  projection resolves the reference before feature and live-file preparation.
- Third-party live writes are always config-only: they never create, replace,
  or delete `auth.json`. `prepare_codex_provider_live_config` projects the
  natively resolved API key onto `experimental_bearer_token` so Codex can authenticate
  without touching the ChatGPT login cache. This is a hard invariant, not the
  leftover `preserveCodexOfficialAuthOnSwitch` setting. Proxy restore
  (`write_codex_live_verbatim`) follows the same split: ChatGPT OAuth login
  material may rewrite `auth.json`; any other stored `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`
  is projected onto live `experimental_bearer_token` and must not recreate
  `auth.json`.
- Provider/source writes are config-only for official and third-party targets.
  They never project a saved Provider's login into `auth.json`. Managed Auth's
  separately confirmed account connection owns auth replacement. Proxy recovery
  remains a distinct exact-preimage operation under its own contract.
- [Codex Request-Source Selection](./codex-source-selection.md) owns desired
  source validation, selector comment/uncomment and the pure targeted TOML
  patch in `codex_config/source_switch.rs`. This writer persists that result
  through the existing guard/backup/readback path. A Provider source switch
  may change its owned model and selected provider table; it is not the
  selector-only config edit performed by an official account connection.

### Migration metadata and official-provider ownership

- Updating a universal Provider preserves an existing Codex child card's
  metadata, creation time, sort position, and independently owned settings.
  Parent-owned connection details still update; a newly generated child uses
  normal initialization. The universal-provider service owns this merge.
- `ProviderMeta.imageExtensionConfigured` is migration-only private metadata.
  For a non-official Provider, missing metadata plus no managed/conflicting
  header is a legacy pending-on draft; no bulk migration writes live TOML.
  The first successful new-provider save or explicit historical choice marks
  the row configured. Displayed state still derives from TOML.
- A fixed official Provider defaults both native capabilities off. Merely
  opening or saving it creates no Provider table.
- The first actual enable creates `model_provider = "custom"` and a minimal
  table with `name = "OpenAI"`, `requires_openai_auth = true`, and
  `wire_api = "responses"` when no suitable table exists.
- `ProviderMeta.codexNativeCapabilitiesGeneratedProvider` claims ownership only
  when the capability operation created that table. A pre-existing inactive
  `custom` table may be reused but is never claimed.
- When both controls are off, an owned table is removed only if it still has
  the exact managed shape and no user fields. Otherwise only capability-owned
  fields are removed. An explicit Provider table takes precedence over unified
  Codex session-history injection.

### Vendor projection and safe session resume

- A native Responses Provider receives a vendor model catalog only when the
  active `base_url` parses as HTTPS to a reviewed hostname. The DeepSeek rule
  permits exactly `deepseek.com` and its dot-delimited subdomains.
- Scheme, hostname, and authority are parsed structurally. Substrings, paths,
  or user information such as `deepseek.com.evil.example`,
  `notdeepseek.com`, or `deepseek.com@evil.example` retain the neutral native
  template and receive no vendor harness instructions.
- Session resume crosses a shell-command boundary. Every persisted session ID
  passes the shared fail-closed validator before command construction. It must
  be nonempty ASCII; its first character is alphanumeric or `_`, and every
  remaining character is alphanumeric, `_`, `-`, or `.`.
- An unsafe ID remains visible in session history but has no `resumeCommand`.
  Do not quote or escape it into a shell string. A wider future grammar requires
  typed argv plus platform-specific launch/copy handling.

### Warnings, proxy projection, and live mutation evidence

- Warning codes are computed from the final saved Provider only when
  WebSocket is `true`. Inspect nonempty top-level `model`, `review_model`, and
  `modelCatalog.models[].model`; use the segment after the final `/` and accept
  an ASCII case-insensitive `gpt-` prefix. Any recognizable non-GPT model emits
  the model warning; no recognizable models do not.
- Active Codex proxy takeover adds the proxy warning. Warnings are omitted for
  switches, failed saves, and empty-risk results. They communicate configuration
  risk, not a transport failure or a claim that the local HTTP/SSE proxy
  supports WebSocket Upgrade.
- Normal and official proxy projections preserve explicit WebSocket state and
  the managed image header while continuing to rewrite routing `base_url` and
  `wire_api` under the proxy contract.
- `liveConfigChanged` is `true` only when a successful operation changes the
  final bytes of the current interactive user's `~/.codex/config.toml`.
  It contains no bytes, digest, path, or credential. Non-Codex mutations return
  `false`. The renderer may use the flag to offer the trusted restart flow from
  [Codex Desktop Installer](./codex-desktop-installer.md), but saving and
  restarting remain separate outcomes.

### Change Plan admission, apply, and recovery

- The reusable executor contract (typed adapter descriptor, five durable
  phases, idempotent replay, cancellation, partial truth, event ordering, and
  crash recovery) is owned by
  [Change Plan Typed Executor](./change-plan-executor.md). This section owns
  only the Codex-specific Provider/projection/security semantics layered on
  that executor.
- Schema 20 owns local-only `change_plans`, `change_jobs`, and append-only
  `change_job_events`. Fresh creation and v19 migration call the same
  idempotent table helper. Retired cloud sync skip/preserve coverage for all
  three remains test-only.
- `create_codex_provider_switch_plan` runs under the existing Provider mutation
  guard, reads DB/device/live baselines, and writes only the credential-free
  ledger. It performs no Provider mutation or network request. The plan expires
  after 15 minutes and stores separate DB/device current IDs.
- `create_codex_provider_upsert_plan` accepts the closed Codex Quick Setup
  request, converts it to the reserved Quick Setup Provider, and likewise
  writes only the credential-free ledger. The intended Provider is held in a
  process-private draft until apply; a lost process makes the plan `stale`.
  The public plan names save-then-set-current as the operation without a
  second confirm payload.
- Switch admission accepts only an existing saved Codex Provider whose
  already-saved material proves that no new credential is needed. Upsert
  admission proves the same capability from the process-private intended
  Provider; bound rows resolve their exact native SecretRef at admission. Unknown or managed auth is
  `secret_dependency_unavailable`; API keys, auth objects, raw config, paths,
  SecretRef/Keychain values, and credential-derived values never enter DTOs,
  ledger rows, errors, or logs.
- `apply_change_plan` accepts only `planId + planDigest`, reacquires the same
  Provider guard, rechecks contract/digest/TTL/consumption/baselines/secret
  capability, atomically consumes the plan, and invokes the lock-held Provider
  writer at most once. Invalid, expired, stale, secret-blocked, or changed-
  digest requests invoke it zero times. A same-digest replay of a consumed v2
  plan returns the existing execution snapshot as an idempotent replay and
  likewise invokes the writer zero additional times.
- When the target is the reserved Codex Quick Setup Provider, Change Plan must
  derive `target_projection_digest` from the **same pure targeted-patch
  projection** consumed by the real Quick Setup writer. The current live
  document is part of that projection so unrelated user comments, fields,
  providers, MCP and feature tables that the writer preserves are also
  expected by readback; they must never be misclassified as post-write drift.
- Readback covers DB current, device current, target definition, and the
  credential-neutral live projection. Mixed/unavailable authority becomes
  `recovery_required`. `get_change_job` and
  `list_recoverable_change_jobs` may converge that ledger state by readback,
  including a prior failed/recovery-required snapshot, but never replay the
  writer. A target reached after uncertain execution is warning, not success;
  a confirmed original baseline is failed/restored. If the executor proves the
  interruption occurred before managed write, it reports
  `interrupted_before_write`; if an unknown post-write outcome is later proven
  at the target, it reports `recovered_target_reached`.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: explicit image enable normalizes only the managed header while
  preserving comments, custom headers, table order, and unrelated Provider
  fields.
- Base: a valid Provider contains no recognizable models. WebSocket remains
  enabled, the save succeeds, and no non-GPT warning is invented.
- Good: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` matches the reviewed hostname rule;
  `https://deepseek.com.evil.example/v1` does not.
- Bad: derive official-provider identity from display name, rewrite invalid TOML
  from form state, use proxy preservation as proof of WebSocket transport, or
  quote an unsafe persisted session ID into a command string.
- Good: Codex quick setup with `codexFeatures.imageExtension = true` writes
  `requires_openai_auth = false`, the managed image header, and
  `experimental_bearer_token` equal to the request `apiKey`, while still
  storing `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Good: the same request with `imageExtension = false` writes
  `requires_openai_auth = true` and `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY` only.
- Bad: enable image-extension, set `requires_openai_auth = false`, and leave
  the API key only in `auth.json`. Current Codex will not send that key.
- Good: two managed ChatGPT logins that share one Team workspace keep distinct
  `credential_id` values; Provider binding stores only that ID.
- Bad: key the OAuth store by `chatgpt_account_id`, copy a token package onto
  the Provider row, or overwrite `auth.json` while the live store is `keyring`.

## 6. Tests Required

- Rust/TOML fixtures cover lossless unrelated edits, complete-document failure,
  invalid field shapes, case-variant header normalization, empty-table cleanup,
  WebSocket enable/remove, and official minimal-table ownership/cleanup.
- Migration fixtures cover pending legacy rows, explicit choices, newly created
  Providers, reused unowned tables, and exact owned-shape retirement.
- Hostname fixtures cover the approved HTTPS host and subdomains plus scheme,
  user-info, substring, suffix, and path-confusion rejections.
- Session fixtures cover ordinary UUID/provider-prefixed IDs and every rejected
  empty, leading-hyphen, non-ASCII, whitespace, quote, separator, and control
  character class.
- Result tests cover byte-exact `liveConfigChanged`, non-Codex false results,
  warning ordering/deduplication, GPT/non-GPT catalogs, proxy warnings, switches,
  and failed saves. Renderer tests prove only successful changed Codex saves can
  offer the separate trusted restart flow.
- Auth-projection tests cover image-on stored shape writing both
  `experimental_bearer_token` and stored `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`, image-off
  stored TOML omitting the bearer field, third-party live switches never
  rewriting `auth.json` while projecting the key to
  `experimental_bearer_token`, Proxy `write_codex_live_verbatim` restore of a
  third-party `OPENAI_API_KEY` backup leaving ChatGPT `auth.json` unchanged,
  official source switching preserving auth bytes, and leftover preserve=false
  not restoring overwrite. Auth account projection is tested by Managed Auth.
- Change Plan tests cover 0/v19 to schema 20, sync skip/local preserve,
  zero-side-effect planning, 15-minute expiry, concurrent single admission,
  writer exactly once/zero on rejection, same-plan idempotent replay,
  pre-write cancellation, five-phase durable event ordering,
  normal/backup-only/live-takeover
  projection parity, fixed-Quick-Setup targeted-patch projection parity,
  credential-negative persistence/serialization, and recovery-required
  readback convergence/fault recovery without replay. Generic executor tests
  and the shared v2 DTO fixture are specified in
  [Change Plan Typed Executor](./change-plan-executor.md).
- Codex OAuth store tests cover v2 `credential_id` keys, same-workspace two
  users, v1 backup + idempotent migrate, unique vs ambiguous Provider binding
  remap, corrupt/I/O load failure keeping `store_loaded=false` and preserving
  all bindings, bound-missing fail-closed forwarding, leftover `auth_*` mutations
  returning `legacy_auth_mutation_disabled`, Debug/DTO token redaction, explicit
  `file` or unset effective-store capability, and fail-closed
  `keyring`/`auto`/`ephemeral`/invalid/unknown without consulting `auth.json`
  existence. File capability alone still does not admit an account projection.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```text
provider URL contains "deepseek.com" -> enable vendor behavior
session resume = "codex resume '" + persistedId + "'"
save succeeded -> liveConfigChanged = true
```

Correct:

```text
parsed HTTPS hostname matches reviewed host rule -> vendor behavior
persisted ID passes conservative ASCII grammar -> construct established command
successful final live bytes differ -> liveConfigChanged = true
imageExtension true -> requires_openai_auth = false
  + experimental_bearer_token = apiKey
  + stored auth.OPENAI_API_KEY = apiKey
imageExtension false -> requires_openai_auth = true
  + stored auth.OPENAI_API_KEY = apiKey
  + no stored experimental_bearer_token
third-party live write -> config-only + live experimental_bearer_token
  + auth.json unchanged
managed ChatGPT account map key = credential_id
  + chatgpt_account_id is routing metadata only
  + Provider.authBinding.accountId = credential_id
effective store is file-capable when cli_auth_credentials_store is unset or explicit "file"
Managed Auth separately proves complete material, identity, revision, and readback
successful OAuth store load -> remap legacy Provider bindings
OAuth store load failure -> preserve all bindings; do not treat memory as empty authority
```

## Scenario: Codex Quick Setup targeted live write

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: the reserved Quick Setup Provider ID is written or switched to live.
  Its persisted `fyagent-v2-*` identifier is compatibility identity, not a
  second renderer generation; this documentation cleanup does not rename it.
- The stored Provider remains a minimum snapshot. It is **not** the authority
  for unrelated user-owned `config.toml` or `auth.json` fields.
- Imported/saved request-source switches also preserve unowned live content
  through the focused `source_switch` projection. Quick Setup retains its
  narrower form-field ownership; do not use a full snapshot as the live file.

### 2. Signatures

```text
patch_codex_quick_setup_live_config(currentConfig, desiredQuickSetupConfig)
  -> patchedConfig

build_codex_quick_setup_live_projection(currentLive, fixedQuickSetupProvider)
  -> { auth, config }

ProviderService::quick_setup_write_targets(Codex)
  -> [{ path, backupPath, exists }, ...]

write_live_with_common_config(Codex, fixedQuickSetupProvider)
  -> consume the same targeted projection and write its owned physical targets
```

### 3. Contracts

- Parse the current live TOML with `toml_edit::DocumentMut`. Invalid current
  TOML fails closed; never rebuild a minimal document from form state.
- The fixed Quick Setup patch may own top-level `model_provider` and `model`,
  plus its active provider's `name`, `base_url`, `wire_api`,
  `requires_openai_auth`, managed image header, managed WebSocket field, and
  managed bearer-token field. A historical fixed row that does not yet carry a
  modern owned field preserves the current live value rather than guessing a
  default.
- Existing `disable_response_storage`, `review_model`, other providers,
  comments, ordering, unrelated provider fields/headers, MCP, features,
  projects, hooks, desktop, memory/history, sandbox/approval, and user tables
  survive.
- Quick Setup is always config-only. `auth.json` is not written and is
  absent from `writeTargets`. The submitted key is projected through the
  provider-scoped bearer-token path in `config.toml`. The writer must not
  parse an untouched `auth.json` merely to perform this config-only write;
  official ChatGPT login bytes are not a write prerequisite.
- The leftover `preserveCodexOfficialAuthOnSwitch` setting is ignored. There
  is no compatibility mode that writes third-party keys into `auth.json`.
- The pure final-state projection is shared with Change Plan. Do not duplicate
  Quick Setup patch logic in the planner/readback owner: otherwise unrelated
  preserved TOML can make a successful targeted write look like drift.
- Physical writes use [Reversible User Configuration](./reversible-user-config.md).
  One synchronous Provider operation retains each file's first preimage across
  internal writes such as MCP reconciliation. Backups are private and backup
  failure blocks mutation; no source means no fabricated original backup.
- `writeTargets` must list exactly the physical files the current mode can
  mutate. Renderer code displays it but never supplies a path back to Rust.
- `get_provider_summary` retains root `writeTargets` for Quick Setup and adds
  per-Provider `writeTargets` for saved source selection. A non-Quick-Setup
  Codex source with a generated model catalog also lists
  `fyagent-model-catalog.json` and its backup. A config-only Quick Setup does
  not claim that extra write. The runtime parser requires the per-source list;
  the selected plan freezes the matching disclosure before confirmation.
- Change Plan current/target projection digests bind the native Codex home in
  addition to the credential-neutral routing shape. Changing an override to a
  same-content directory invalidates admission; a raw path is never persisted
  in the public plan. Old incompatible digest evidence fails closed.
- Official source admission requires an already-preserved strict consumer
  login, not credentials stored on the selected Provider. Establishing or
  changing that account uses the independent Auth confirmation flow.

### Explicit API protocol and public connection readback

`ProviderQuickSetupRequest.protocol` is optional and closed to
`anthropic | responses | chat`. Native `services/provider_api.rs` resolves
compatible defaults before derivation and rejects target/protocol mismatches.
Codex accepts Responses/Chat; Claude accepts Anthropic; Grok Build accepts
Responses. Codex TOML carries the selected `wire_api` verbatim. Chat rejects
Responses-only image/WebSocket intent and marks image migration complete with
the feature off, preventing save normalization from changing its protocol.

The same policy rejects known Alibaba plan/key/address mismatches. Generic
model-fetch/model-probe commands reject known tool-only plan endpoints or
`sk-sp-` credentials before network; alternate model-list URLs cannot bypass
the guard. Explicit model-probe protocol chooses both the URL and request body.
No credentials are tested by preset selection.

`get_provider_summary` may serialize a closed optional `connection` projection:
`baseUrl`, `modelId`, `protocol`. It reads only recognized Claude env, selected
Codex provider TOML or selected Grok model TOML. Wrong target/protocol, unknown
shape, unsafe URL, control/oversized fields or collisions with known credential
sources omit the projection. Encoded URL credential collisions reuse the
existing URL collision owner. No credential/reference is resolved or returned.

Quick Setup continues to require a nonempty submitted Key before invoking the
existing Provider persistence facade; it does not infer same-identity credential
reuse from the fixed row ID. Existing transaction, targeted file patch,
compensation and authoritative readback remain the sole mutation authority.

### Actual target summary observation

`get_provider_summary.live` is a closed read-only projection of the actual
target, independent of DB `currentId` and saved Provider snapshots. The command
uses `ProviderService::quick_setup_write_targets` for native target existence
and `ProviderService::read_live_settings` for the file read. It never reuses the
display path as read authority, resolves credentials, calls a model endpoint,
or writes config/backups. Existing reader errors are reduced to an unreadable
state without logging/returning their text.

The projection exposes target identity, `configured | not_configured | missing |
unreadable`, nullable existence, and an optional partial public connection.
Missing fields stay null. A file without explicit model/endpoint is
not_configured; protocol alone is insufficient. Codex honors an explicit file
profile and selected provider, with no inferred protocol/endpoint defaults or
CLI/runtime overrides. Claude env and Grok selected-model formats are separately
projected through the same boundary.

Known credential leaves/headers from saved records and the live document
(including parsed TOML and auth) are collected without secret resolution. Public
model/endpoint fields are bounded and reject control characters, unsafe URLs,
and credential collisions; encoded URL collisions use the existing WorkBuddy
URL owner. Unknown/raw secret fields never enter the DTO. Live failures and
write-target metadata failures preserve valid saved sources, but bad saved
identity/credential collisions still fail the whole public summary closed.

`commands/provider/live_summary/tests.rs` uses real temporary target files and
an in-memory DB to prove external routing can differ from the saved current
source, missing/empty/corrupt/unsafe files remain distinct, read errors do not
echo secret text, metadata failure preserves saved sources, and reads leave
primary bytes and backup absence unchanged.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                                   | Required result                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current `config.toml` is invalid or `model_providers` is not editable       | Reject; no backup/primary rewrite from the minimum snapshot                     |
| Quick Setup would need `auth.json` to be a JSON object                      | Do not parse or write it; continue the config-only path                         |
| Required backup cannot be created or source permissions cannot be preserved | Reject; primary file remains byte-for-byte unchanged                            |
| Config exists for a third-party Quick Setup write                           | Back up/write config only; leave auth bytes untouched                           |
| Untouched `auth.json` is missing or not parseable                           | Config-only Quick Setup still does not parse/write auth; preserve bytes exactly |
| Existing unrelated provider/header/MCP/feature fields are present           | Preserve them while changing only owned Quick Setup fields                      |
| Fixed historical row omits a modern optional owned field                    | Preserve the corresponding current live field; do not invent a default          |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a large hand-written config keeps comments, other providers, custom
  headers, MCP, features, and `disable_response_storage = false`; only the
  selected Quick Setup route changes and the backup equals the exact old file.
- Base: first creation has no config preimage, so no backup file is fabricated;
  the new config is still created atomically.
- Good: official ChatGPT login stays byte-identical in `auth.json` and the
  third-party key is placed in the active provider bearer field only.
- Bad: serialize the minimum Quick Setup Provider as the complete
  `config.toml`, or overwrite all of `auth.json` with `{ OPENAI_API_KEY }`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Large TOML fixture: assert comments, unrelated top-level keys, other provider,
  custom provider field/header, MCP and features survive while owned route
  fields change.
- Assert each mutated file's rolling backup equals its operation preimage;
  untouched auth is byte-identical and has no new backup.
- Assert backup failure leaves the primary unchanged.
- Assert Claude/Codex/Grok fixed Quick Setup rows all use targeted projection,
  so switching back to a saved reserved row cannot reintroduce full-file
  clobbering.
- Auth-preservation test: summary lists config only, auth bytes remain exact,
  and live config contains the required provider-scoped bearer token. The
  leftover preserve setting being false must not change this outcome.
- Change Plan parity fixture: seed unrelated comment/review-model/provider/MCP/
  feature content, apply the fixed Quick Setup row through Change Plan, assert
  terminal success and byte/semantic preservation of every unowned field.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
stored quick-setup Provider.config -> replace ~/.codex/config.toml
stored quick-setup Provider.auth   -> replace ~/.codex/auth.json
```

#### Correct

```text
current live preimage
  -> validate
  -> patch only Quick Setup-owned fields
  -> exact single rolling backup of each existing target
  -> atomic primary write
```

## Scenario: Codex image-mode API key projection

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: current Codex does not attach `auth.json`'s `OPENAI_API_KEY` when
  the active provider sets `requires_openai_auth = false`. FyAgent image
  extension writes that field to `false`, so the API key must also live on
  the provider table as `experimental_bearer_token`.

### 2. Signatures

```text
ProviderQuickSetupRequest.codexFeatures.imageExtension: Option<bool>
into_provider(AppType::Codex) -> Provider.settings_config { auth, config }
write_codex_live_for_provider(category, auth, config_text)
project_codex_live_config_when_openai_auth_disabled(auth, config_text) -> config_text
```

### 3. Contracts

- Request: Quick Setup `apiKey` plus optional `codexFeatures.imageExtension`.
- Stored Codex shape always keeps `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Image on: `[model_providers.custom].requires_openai_auth = false` and
  stored `experimental_bearer_token` equals the same `apiKey`.
- Image off: stored `requires_openai_auth = true`; no stored image-mode
  bearer token.
- Third-party live write: never write `auth.json`. Always run
  `prepare_codex_provider_live_config` so the stored API key is projected
  onto live `experimental_bearer_token`.
- Official Provider/source writes never replace `auth.json` from a stored row.
  Source validation and targeted config projection are independent of account
  projection; authentication changes use Managed Auth's preview and file store
  checks. This does not alter exact-preimage Proxy recovery semantics.
- Environment: live files remain `~/.codex/auth.json` and
  `~/.codex/config.toml`. No new env key.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Empty `apiKey` -> quick setup rejects before TOML derivation.
- Invalid TOML at live write -> existing parse error; do not synthesize a
  bearer token onto a document that cannot be parsed.
- No API key and `requires_openai_auth = false` -> do not invent a token;
  `prepare_codex_provider_live_config` leaves the text unchanged.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: image-on quick setup stores the API key on the Provider and lives it
  as `experimental_bearer_token` without rewriting `auth.json`.
- Base: image-off quick setup is still config-only; live `auth.json` stays
  byte-identical and the live provider table receives the bearer projection.
- Bad: write third-party `OPENAI_API_KEY` or a saved official Provider token
  into live `auth.json` as a side effect of selecting a model source.

### 6. Tests Required

- `quick_setup_request_writes_image_extension_and_websocket_features`
- `quick_setup_request_disabling_image_keeps_requires_openai_auth_true`
- `quick_setup_request_derives_the_fixed_provider_shape` (no bearer token)
- `source_switch` validation and comment-preserving targeted-patch tests

- `write_codex_live_verbatim_third_party_key_does_not_replace_oauth_login`
- `codex_empty_restore_snapshot_does_not_delete_existing_auth_json`

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
imageExtension true -> requires_openai_auth = false
live auth.json OPENAI_API_KEY = apiKey
live config.toml has no experimental_bearer_token
```

#### Correct

```text
imageExtension true -> stored requires_openai_auth = false
stored auth.OPENAI_API_KEY = apiKey
live config.toml experimental_bearer_token = apiKey
live auth.json unchanged
```
