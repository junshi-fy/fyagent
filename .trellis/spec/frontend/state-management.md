# State Management

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Read before adding route state, caches, drafts, persistence or polling. The hash
router is the sole navigation state owner; `FeatureProvider` owns the product
QueryClient and session feature context. There is no parallel application store.

## 2. Signatures and owners

`app/PersistentPrimaryOutlet.tsx` keeps visited primary routes behind
`shared/ui/PersistentSurface.tsx`. `usePersistentVisibility()` exposes actual
surface activity; `usePersistentSearchParams` freezes a hidden route's last URL.
`shared/features/queries.ts` owns `featureKeys`, including prefix invalidations
such as `featureKeys.dailyMemorySearches`.

| State                        | Owner                       | Route-leave behavior                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Route, shareable target/tab  | Hash URL                    | Hidden pages freeze their own search; active route remains authoritative.                  |
| Backend resource             | Query + FeaturePort/backend | Cache/reread according to the owner; automatic queries stop while hidden.                  |
| Install/Auth/Change Plan job | Native job/session          | Native operation may continue without a visible page.                                      |
| Non-secret unsaved draft     | Route-local controller      | Visited keep-alive may retain it; target/session change follows its explicit draft policy. |
| Transient visual state       | Component                   | Never becomes business authority or delays revocation.                                     |
| Secret input                 | Narrow local lifetime       | Clear immediately under the owning security contract.                                      |

## 3. Contracts

Unvisited routes create no DOM/query/observer effects. Preloading a module is
not mounting it. A visited hidden route is not a background job daemon: its
automatic queries, scan dispatch and polling derive `enabled` from persistent
visibility. Manual refetch requires an active owning surface. Freeze hidden URL
observations so hidden pages cannot rewrite the current route's query string.

Native `FeatureProvider` intentionally pins `focusManager.setFocused(true)`:
catalog/Auth queries gating frontend-ready must settle while the native WebView
is still `document.hidden`. Do not gate startup authority on document visibility
or RAF; this would reintroduce a hidden-window startup deadlock. Route visibility
is a different lifecycle boundary and continues to gate nonvisible pages.

Use shared key factories for reads and mutation invalidation, including prefixes.
The current in-memory namespace is `fyagent`, owned by `featureKeys` in
`shared/features/queries.ts`; consumers use that factory rather than literals.
Persisted provider identifiers,
native jobs and wire versions are not renamed with the cache namespace.
Wait for authoritative rereads where the feature requires them; a successful
mutation promise alone does not prove the effective configuration changed.

Change Plan's Query-owned observer has its own zero-retention, revision ordering,
multi-observer cancellation and secret-write rules in
[Change Plan Workspaces](./change-plan-workspaces.md). Do not generalize that
resource-specific cache policy to every query or add component interval owners.

Avoid render-phase state synchronization except the reviewed keep-alive route,
hidden-search snapshot and Dialog presence-registration owners. Their guarded
adjustments preserve a specific lifetime, not a second `currentView` store.
Host updates have an independent `shared/features/app-update` provider and
narrow FeaturePorts adapter. Automatic checks only indicate a new version in
the shell; download/install requires a user action. Version skips are local
preferences. Do not add automatic downloads, migration bypasses or renderer-written
native settings during cleanup.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                              | Required result                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A route is preloaded but never visited | No mounted page effects or native observation.                                    |
| A visited route becomes hidden         | Preserve permitted draft state; stop automatic work and revoke active UI/portals. |
| Hidden page sees another route's query | Keep its previous search; do not write the active URL.                            |
| Native startup WebView is hidden       | Required authority queries can settle and acknowledge readiness.                  |
| Save succeeds but reread fails         | Show unknown/refresh failure, not an invented successful effective state.         |
| Key prefix changes                     | Update readers, mutations and prefix consumers together with behavior tests.      |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

Good: invalidate `featureKeys.dailyMemorySearches` after a native memory write.
Base: a native job continues while the route stops polling and reconciles on
return. Bad: use `document.hidden` for startup or retain credentials in a global
Query/store for animation convenience.

## 6. Tests Required

Run unit and browser gates. `tests/renderer/app/route-render-isolation.test.tsx`,
router-shell, PersistentSurface and persistent-search tests prove hidden-route
isolation. Frontend-ready tests retain native-hidden startup coverage. Feature
tests cover dirty navigation, secret clearing, failed rereads and exact keys.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: `queryKey: ["v2", "memory", "daily", "search"]` in a page.
Correct: `queryKey: featureKeys.dailyMemorySearches`, shared with the resource
queries. Read [Navigation](./navigation.md) for the exact route lifetime.
