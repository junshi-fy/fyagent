# Renderer MCP Management UI Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Read this contract before changing the Renderer MCP installed/discovery views,
quick/advanced editor, presets, import, target assignment, bulk assignment,
ordinary-detail redaction, or MCP mutation/error handling.

Primary owners are:

- `src/pages/mcp/Page.tsx`, `Discovery.tsx`, `InstallDialog.tsx`, and
  `catalog.ts` for current route behavior;
- `src/shared/features/mcp.ts` for renderer MCP types;
- `src/shared/features/mcpSecurity.ts` and the MCP helpers in
  `src/shared/features/helpers.ts` for display/search redaction and editor
  serialization;
- `src/shared/features/ports.ts` and
  `src/shared/platform/tauri/feature-ports/simple.ts` for `McpPort` IPC;
- `src/shared/features/queries.ts` for the installed-server query.

Shared target presentation is owned by
[Renderer Shared Assignment](./assignments.md). Native validation, persistence,
live-file ordering, import, and conflict semantics are owned by
[MCP Management](../backend/mcp-management.md).

QoderWork/TRAE external MCP preflight is not part of this management page; it
uses `ExternalMcpPort` in the relevant Agent configuration flow.

FDE discovery membership and cloud/data command/env defaults are owned by
[FDE MCP Catalogue](./mcp-fde-catalog.md); do not duplicate those recipes here.

## 2. Signatures

The current management Port is exactly:

```ts
interface McpPort {
  getAll(): Promise<Record<string, McpServer>>;
  upsert(server: McpServer): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
  toggleApp(
    serverId: string,
    app: McpTargetId,
    enabled: boolean,
  ): Promise<void>;
  importFromApps(sources?: McpImportSourceId[]): Promise<McpImportReport>;
}
```

The renderer model is intentionally open to native/vendor fields:

```ts
interface McpServerSpec extends Record<string, unknown> {
  type?: "stdio" | "http" | "sse";
  command?: string;
  args?: string[];
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  cwd?: string;
  url?: string;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
}

interface McpServer extends Record<string, unknown> {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  server: McpServerSpec;
  apps: McpAssignments;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  homepage?: string;
  docs?: string;
  source?: string;
  sources?: McpImportSourceId[];
}
```

Import source IDs are the nine native target IDs, distinct from the seven
assignment controls. `McpImportReport` is version 1 with one requested-source
row containing `source`, nonnegative safe-integer `added`,
`assignmentChanged`, `unchanged`, `disabledSkipped`, and
`failureCode: null | "source_failed"`. Display separate accepted/state-change/
unchanged/disabled-skip/failure results; zero added rows does not mean there
was nothing to import. The report also requires nonnegative safe-integer
projectionFailed and projectionFailures, with an exact count/list-length match.
Each failure has a closed target ID, serverId (nonempty string or null for a
collection/target-level failure), and reason from invalid_config, io_failed,
projection_failed. Failure targets must correspond to an accepted selected
source. Unknown/missing fields and reason codes are rejected.
Show projection failure count and target/reason separately from source failures
using hardcoded Chinese copy. Accepted library rows remain visible on partial
projection failure; raw native errors/paths/secrets are never displayed.

`createSimpleFeaturePorts().mcp` is currently a thin, compile-time-typed Tauri
adapter over these exact commands:

```text
get_mcp_servers
upsert_mcp_server        { server }
delete_mcp_server        { id }
toggle_mcp_app           { serverId, app, enabled }
import_mcp_from_apps     { sources } // omitted selection retains legacy all-source request
```

The adapter validates a nonempty unique closed source selection, parses the
versioned import report and validates source metadata on the read view. It
retains thin mapping for the other management calls. Invalid version, counts,
source identity/order or failure shape cannot be presented as successful import.

## 3. Contracts

### Query and mutation ownership

- `useMcpServers()` owns the installed map under `featureKeys.mcp`. List,
  detail, search, and assignment render from this query result.
- `McpPage.write` owns a page-wide `writeLock`, busy state, success notification and safe failure feedback,
  and `featureKeys.mcp` invalidation/refetch after command success or failure. A concurrent management-page
  write is ignored before native invocation.
- Upsert, delete, one-target toggle, import, and sequential bulk assignment all
  go through `McpPort`; the page never serializes a vendor live file or calls a
  compatibility Tauri command directly.
- Import requires an explicit source selection and confirmation; cancellation
  invokes no import. Show persisted import origins independently from catalogue
  publisher metadata, assignment flags and connection status. Legacy rows with
  no recorded origins say that the source was not recorded. A successful import
  or assignment does not prove a connection; an untested connection remains
  untested.
- Unified upsert can return an adapter validation/write error after native code
  has already saved the SQLite row and before every enabled live target was
  projected. The page sanitizes the error and invalidates/refetches the MCP
  query after settlement; the reread may therefore show a durable row after a
  failure feedback. Do not claim native rollback or remove that row optimistically.
- The management page does not use `useAuthoritativeAssignmentMutation`.
  `toggleApp` returns `void`; convergence happens by invalidating/refetching the
  installed query after the command settles. Do not claim the toggle command
  directly returns authoritative MCP state or atomically rolls back.
- Bulk assignment calls `toggleApp` sequentially, records each failure, then
  reports successful/failed counts. Earlier successful items remain applied
  when a later item fails.
- A native command error is sanitized through
  `sanitizeMcpConfigurationError`; the raw backend string is not rendered.

- Single-save command or reread failure keeps the editor and its exact draft
  open. Present the sanitized error beside the footer actions, retain an
  accessible bounded error region, and focus a correction field without
  discarding other input. Close only after the confirmed success path.
- When the editor callback owns inline failure feedback, suppress the duplicate
  error toast so it cannot cover the footer controls on a compact viewport.
  Browser evidence waits for dialog settlement and checks correction focus and
  save/cancel visibility after the actual screenshot.
- Single-delete failure keeps confirmation open and states that some target
  configuration may already have changed. Allow cancellation or review before
  retry; never claim all targets were removed or that native rollback occurred.
- Sanitized parse/I/O messages describe the observed failure category without
  inferring a write stage. Do not render raw paths, headers or secret-bearing
  native strings. Reread failure after a successful command is still unconfirmed.

### Quick and advanced editor

- New IDs are trimmed, required, and rejected when already present in the
  current installed map. An existing ID is fixed while editing; `name` is also
  required.
- A global new editor draft starts from empty `DEFAULT_NEW_APPS`: save to the
  library without assigning an Agent. An explicit `creationTarget` prop may
  select only that one target; remembered discovery preferences are not authority
  for manual creation. Editing starts from stored flags. Discovery still uses
  its single selected target and confirmation. The editor makes library-only
  versus selected-target persistence explicit before saving.
- Native unified upsert validates the base transport shape before DB writes or
  removal of old assignments. Target-specific projection may still partially
  fail after save; this does not introduce an atomic multi-target transaction.
- Quick mode supports three transports:
  - stdio: non-empty `command`, newline-delimited `args`, optional `cwd`, and
    `KEY=VALUE` env rows;
  - http/sse: a URL accepted by `new URL(...)` plus optional `Name: Value` or
    `Name=Value` header rows.
- `parseKeyValueLines` reports malformed rows but allows later duplicate keys
  to replace earlier values in the local map. Native validation remains the
  final authority.
- Advanced mode accepts one JSON object and rejects a top-level `mcpServers`
  wrapper. It intentionally preserves unknown fields because
  `McpServerSpec` extends `Record<string, unknown>`. This local parser does not
  validate the types/requirements of every known transport field. The unified
  native upsert validates base transport requirements even for library-only
  entries before mutation. Target-specific compatibility remains with adapters.
- Moving quick -> advanced overlays the seven known transport fields onto the
  previous draft while preserving unknown fields. Moving advanced -> quick
  parses the JSON object and projects known fields into the form.
- Switching the selected quick transport does not erase the opposite family
  from React state immediately. `quickSpec()` emits only the active family, and
  `overlayKnownMcpFields` removes all old known transport fields before
  applying it, so hidden quick-form values are not persisted in that save.
- Presets are local structured `mcpPresets`; applying one clears env/header
  form text and still passes through the same editor/native save path.

### Current sensitive-value boundary

- The current native DTO returns raw `env` and `headers` so an existing server
  can be edited. Those values therefore exist in the installed query data and
  in the editor's textarea/advanced JSON while the dialog is open. FyAgent does
  not currently replace them with `SecretRef` or a write-only placeholder at
  this renderer boundary.
- Ordinary detail avoids rendering env/header values and shows only their
  counts. It redacts recognized secret-bearing URL query parameters and command
  arguments with `redactMcpUrl` / `redactMcpArgs`.
- Search excludes env/header maps, strips URL query/fragment values from its
  URL token, and uses redacted arguments. Command, cwd, ID, name, tags, source,
  homepage, and docs remain searchable/displayable according to current UI.
- The editor dialog is the only current UI intended to expose raw env/header
  values. Cancel or successful save unmounts it; a failed save deliberately
  leaves the dialog and draft open for correction. Do not claim every failure
  clears the draft.
- No current copy/export action serializes the full server object. Any future
  copy/log/analytics path must explicitly redact env/header values and
  secret-bearing URL/argument positions before release.

### Discovery, import, assignment, and trust copy

- Installed detail shows source and transport in its header. Configuration and
  provenance share one installation section, collapsed by default and expandable
  by keyboard. Main actions and assignment switches remain directly visible;
  descriptions and local directories appear when supplied.
- Copy-only directory assertions target `CopyablePath` itself. An explicitly
  displayed absolute command can legitimately contain the same directory;
  combining metadata must not turn that fact into a false redaction failure.
- Discovery uses the local reviewed catalog and builds an `McpServer` for
  `McpPort.upsert`; it is not a runtime/network test of the recipe.
- The header owns add/import actions, including when the installed list is empty.
  Import delegates to `importFromApps()` and reports the returned imported count.
  Native code owns per-target parsing and conflict behavior.
- The seven target rows and order come from `MCP_TARGETS`. Assignment pages do
  not construct vendor paths or choose the native write format.
- Enabling/installing WorkBuddy opens the product's trust disclosure after the
  command succeeds; it does not prove WorkBuddy reloaded the configuration.
- Detail may show a derived install directory from `cwd` or an absolute command
  parent through `CopyablePath`. This is explicit user-facing local-path UI,
  not a claim that paths never enter the renderer.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** edit a stdio server, preserve an unknown native field in advanced
  mode, save through `McpPort.upsert`, then render the invalidated query result.
- **Good:** toggle several servers sequentially for one target; report partial
  failure counts and retain successful earlier writes.
- **Base:** a failed upsert leaves the editor open with its draft so the user
  can correct it. The invalidated query may show a row already saved by native
  before target projection failed; that durable state is not hidden or called
  rolled back.
- **Base:** an HTTP URL contains a token query parameter; the editor can show it
  for editing, while detail/search redact or omit the value.
- **Bad:** call a nonexistent `McpPorts.validate`, claim runtime DTO parsing in
  `simple.ts`, claim native upsert always validates before SQLite, treat
  `toggleApp(): void` as returned authoritative state, clear unknown advanced
  fields, or display env/header values in normal detail.

## 6. Tests Required

Run the focused Renderer checks through the repository task runner. Required
assertion owners include:

- `tests/renderer/platform/featurePorts.test.ts`: exact five `McpPort` command names,
  camelCase payload keys, selection/version/count/source parsing, and return mapping;
- `tests/renderer/features/featurePages.test.tsx`: installed loading/error/cached-data
  states, add/edit/delete/import, assignment, sequential partial bulk behavior,
  invalidation, and sanitized errors;
  import source selection/cancellation, partial source counts, zero-added state
  changes and disabled skips, independent persisted origins and untested status;
- `tests/renderer/features/helpers.test.ts`: quick key/value parsing, advanced-object
  rules, known-field overlay, selection/search, and error sanitization;
- `tests/renderer/features/mcpSecurity.test.ts` and
  `tests/renderer/features/mcpCatalog.test.ts`: URL/argument redaction, search tokens,
  recipe identity, and reviewed catalog projection;
- `tests/renderer/shared/AssignmentPanel.test.tsx`: semantic seven-target controls;
- `tests/renderer/app/architecture.test.ts`: route/shared component ownership and no
  page-level Tauri/vendor-file imports.

Browser fixtures prove renderer interaction only. Native file projection,
save-before-projection failure, conflict handling, and vendor reload require
the backend/native evidence named by
[MCP Management](../backend/mcp-management.md).

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```ts
const result = await ports.mcp.toggleApp(serverId, target, enabled);
setServer(result); // toggleApp returns void; no authoritative server is returned.
```

Correct:

```ts
try {
  await ports.mcp.toggleApp(serverId, target, enabled);
} finally {
  await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: featureKeys.mcp });
}
// Render the query result; a native error is not described as atomic rollback.
```

Wrong:

```ts
logger.info(server.server.env);
const searchable = JSON.stringify(server.server);
```

Correct:

```ts
const args = redactMcpArgs(server.server.args ?? []);
const url = server.server.url ? redactMcpUrl(server.server.url) : undefined;
// Ordinary UI excludes env/header values; raw values stay in the editor only.
```
